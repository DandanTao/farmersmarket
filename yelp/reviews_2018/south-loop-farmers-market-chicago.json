            "description": "The guy and I stopped by this market and I could not believe how fantastic the prices were! We got there late (around 2:30pm) and they were starting to wrap up, but we managed to pick up a huge box of strawberries (about 12 one pint containers), a huge box of ripe vine tomatoes and a box of green seedless grapes. We had enough fruit for about a month, and we got the whole thing for $20. \n\nThe best part is that this farmer's market is right in front of the new Whole Foods. \n\nSee you next week!",

            "description": "I'm gong to go ahead and echo the reviewer below who said this is \"barely a farmer's market.\"\nIt's more accurately about 8-10 booths set up in a church parking lot, and only half of them have food (produce, baked goods, and the other staples you would expect at a farmer's market).\nI was definitely disappointed. I wasn't expecting the same size as Lincoln Park's, but this was a bit pathetic to be frank. I'd save my time if I were you, but if you insist on trying it out, it takes place on Thursdays from 4-8pm.",
