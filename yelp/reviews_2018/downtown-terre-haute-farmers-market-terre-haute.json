            "description": "Last Saturday, I was in Terre Haute (don't bother with the map, there's no reason for you to know where it is) and noticed advertisements for a farmer's market.  I figured what the hell, its right next to a coffee shop, and I need coffee anyway. \n\nThe basic produce was expected (tomatoes, corn, peaches, apples, etc), but Spanish Black radishes, and free range beef, pork, chicken, and lamb were a nice surprise.  Granted, farmer's markets in larger cities will have more vendors and a larger variety of produce, but this is the best small town market within a 50 mile radius.  If I'm in town on a Saturday again this summer, I will be returning (with a cooler for the meat)!",
