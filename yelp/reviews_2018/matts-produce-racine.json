            "description": "Matt's Produce has hands-down the best tasting sweet corn in SE WI. They pick their sweet corn fresh, several times a day, so it's not sitting out wilting and drying up like at the store or other roadside stands. All of their other veggies are great, too, tasting like you just picked them fresh out of your garden-- all the benefit of \"homegrown veggies\" without any of the work! I get my Produce from them all summer and into the fall. I love knowing that they only sell the highest quality goods, and not having to worry about digging through piles of vegetables to find the one or two good ones-- everything Matt puts out on his stand is top-quality!",
