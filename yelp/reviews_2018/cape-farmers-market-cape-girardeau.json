            "description": "The market runs on Thursdays 2-6PM, April through November.\n\nThere's fruits, veggies, plants (including tomato, veggie, herb and flowering plants). Fresh baked goods...bread, cookies, pecan pie!!!, oatmeal brownies, cupcakes, zucchini bread. There's a stand with a guy making fresh donuts. There's honey, jams (Pear Jellyand Tomato Jam, for example). Fresh cut flowers. Gourds. Teas. Cheese. And lots more!   \n\nI've been here several times, and everybody has been super nice. \n\nThere's tons of parking and it's really close to the food stands.",

            "description": "Lots of vendors.  A Mennonite family has baked goods which are delicious - I recommend the whole wheat bread & the pecan sticky buns which aren't too sweet.  I don't recommend the sourdough bread - it tastes like a dry white bread but not sourdough.  Several veggie sellers from Cobden, IL with good produce.",
