This was a cool place to walk around though, and they had a lot of offerings, meat, produce, and specialty items.\n\nWe picked up some lunch at Norton's, and I got a coffee and cronut from the bakery caddy-corner to that. There should be a sitting area near that so people can hang out and eat. We had to stand at a small, wobbly table. Plenty of places for a quick bite or a drink. This is a nice year-round farmers' market. I wish something similar existed where I live.",

We loved the handmade soap area and the Soulard (Sue-lard) Spice Company--we purchased fresh/customized coffee blends and their top selling Soulard Spice Rub! \n\nThey also sell bloodys, cajun food, and there's a bakery too!

            "description": "The Soulard farmers market will always hold a very special place in my heart.  For 5 years this is where I did the majority of my grocery shopping on Saturday mornings.  I would wake up and head to the market.  The market is open year round and you can always find the best produce, and so much other fun stuff here.  \n\nI would generally get my veggies and my fruits here.  They have a lot of places that take just cash, but some take credit cards and event some take EBT.  Most things only coast about a dollar or two for sometimes over a pound of a product.  I used to get a half pound of sprouts each week and never pay more than a dollar.  When things are in season like corn, strawberries,  and other fruits and veggies you can normally find them cheaper here than anywhere else.  \n\nYou can also get meats, eggs, clothing, baked goods, cider, and many other things.  They even have a spot that sells bloody marrys in the morning.  \n\nSoulard Farmers Market is the best and more people need to check them out!!",

They've got that too.\n\nFood vendors such as tamales, beignets, popcorn, pretzels, gumbo.....just to name a few.\n\nOn this trip we enjoyed smoothies, mini donuts, and pretzels.\n\nMany of the produce vendors had really great deals on their beautiful produce.

If you haven't been to the market you should go.  Cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap everything... fruits and vegetables to spices to $4 Bloody Marys.  \n\nHonestly the spice shop can save you BIG money.  Example; Dierbergs charges about $6 for 1.5 ounces of Cayenne Pepper.  Spice shop is $4 for 8 ounces!  All of their spices are super cheap.\n\nDon't forget to like my pics!",

            "description": "This is the prototypical urban farmers market what gives up the awesome. \n\nThere is a fair amount of parking right close by, but be warned on saturdays-which is the main market day-they will be quite busy. Odds are that you'll find a spot somewhere but there will be lots of distracted drivers mishandling vehicles of all kinds all over the place. Take care and don't assume that the car/van/truck/mass of rust and bailing wire backing up in front of you sees and will stop before it runs over a curb/wall/you. \n\nThis is one of the oldest markets in the country being more or less in continual operation since 1779 or so. While it's not what it used to be-some of the local specialty butchers  in particular have faded away-it's still one of the best places to shop for cuisine or foodstuffs of any kind in the area. In addition to numerous food stalls that have tasty tasty meals/snacks/bloody mary's there are a lot of local produce/meat/cheese/pasts/baked goods/smoked meats/whatever can fit into your mouth stalls. This is a large space with five separate inside sections, and a separate semi outdoor area.  If you are with children keep an eye on them as they can disappear into the crowd in a heartbeat. Once separated it's difficult to find one another again, but if it's a husband or mother that you are trying to relocate sooner or later they seem to turn up at the bloody mary booth.  While there are some stalls what sell gifts, trinkets or clothing 90% of everything in here will be selling grocery type stuff for home or prepared meals/snacks of some kind.\n\nDue to the sheer size of the place it can take several hours to wend your way through and retrieve your car. I recommend planning on eating on site-because it's awesome and you'll be here a few hours anyway at least on Saturdays. Weekdays tend to be less crowded as not everything is open. Some places are cash only, some take cards and cash, and most spots are EBT friendly. Pricing is on the lower side of things-especially considering the very high quality and craft of the items sold here.\n\n I'd recommend leaving your four legged friends at home as most pets do not do well with all the strange smells, noises and masses of people. There is a small playground outside for children, unfortunately there tend to be some not so savory adult street type folks around the perimeter. Children won't pick up on this so much-all they will see is the playground -but as an adult take care out there. \n\nOverall this is one of the best-if not the best-markets of it's type in the country, and is a perfect spot for anyone that likes food. Perfect for holiday meal shopping, and food type gifts-jams, gourmet items, soaps and suchlike.",

With a personal love for farmer markets from Boston, San Franciso, New York to Dayton, Cleveland, and Detroit. I have very high expectations, but this place stacks up to the rest. \n\nThings to Note:\n1) Relative large farmer's market, but the best day to go is on Saturday from 7am-11am. \n2) Some stalls are closed in the winter.\n3) Not all the produce is local from MO/IL, etc. - so I would ask or look. This is just a personal preference.\n4) Spices, Meat, Bakery Items and other goodies sold inside\n5) ATM on stand-by but do yourself some favor and bring cash & your own bags.\n6) Grab a bloody-mary before you start\n7) Find the Vietnamese Egg-Roll Stand outside. I always do this. \n8) Find the Asian lady with homemade mini-donuts!\n9) Grab some local balsamic vinegar and foccacia bread\n\nVery inexpensive, non-pretentious with all types of goodies. There are always some serious dollar store items, so pass on that unless you are in need of useless gadgets.",

The spice shop remains a favorite of mine and I always look forward to cramming in there and waiting my turn to try new and old spices. I also tried the popcorn this time and it was also good. There are so many great things about Soulard including its history that you just have to come and see for yourself. The kiddos love it too. If it's cold outside just bundle them up and put them in their stroller or wagon and have a great time. I can't wait to get my fresh duck for thanksgiving!",

            "description": "I have to say if you know your way around vegetables and fruits, this is a great place to be.  I love coming here to buy from local farmers and support them and in return I get some real wholesome food.  \n\nI believe they have a little something here for everyone and they have a nice variety of fresh dairy, breads and meats.  Some foods that are hard to find, you just may find it here, from your local farmer.\n\nIt don't stop there, excellent street food, it is very hard not to buy a sandwich or pastry while strolling through here.\n\nSoulard does have a metered lot that you can park at, or along the streets there are meters as well.  This is a farmers market so don't look for nothing fancy, the farmers I encountered were all nice and customer friendly and tool the time to answer any question I may have had about their products.  Even which peppers might be the sweetest and the best way to cook them or utilize them, I like that.\n\nYou will even find pies and cakes here, herbs and seasoning and flowers...unique drinks and of course a great hot dog stand with beef hot dogs or pork hot dogs and more.\n\nBring your own bags, I saw people with their own miniature grocery carts and backpack to haul their food and purchases in, unless you got a lot of people in your crew or want to make a lot of trips back to your car, be prepared with bags and carts for the load.\n\nSoulard is a large farmers market and it looks as though there are more than 50 vendors in there alone and I probably wouldn't be to far off to say well over 75 with street food and cooked foods and butchers and florist too.\n\nBring lots of cash, even though most take credit cards and EBT, sometimes the machines are not working, just have the cash for backup and you know that Samsung Pay works at most of these old card terminals too, so if you are techy like me and want to pay with your phone or watch do it.",

And while ribs are more important than everything else, the everything else that you can find here at the Farmers Market makes me reconsider [but not retract] that statement.\n\nBefore we get into all that, you should know that there's a definite New Orleans vibe happening here (and all over St. Louis); maybe it migrated up the Mississippi...all I know is that you can get a legit bloody mary from Julia's for only $4 (and beignets if you'd like). It's got pickled asparagus and a spicy bean, and sipping on that thing as you peruse the rest of the market is the move.\n\nWhat else can you peruse? \n\nPimped out pickles. Pecan pie in a jar. Any kind of meat you'd ever want, including pig ears. Fruit Loops kettlecorn. NFL jerseys, mugs, t-shirts, hats, etc. Goose Poop. Seafood. Every kind of fresh produce you can think of. Pork rinds. Mini-doughnuts. Spices. Flowers. Roasted nuts. SO MUCH SOAP. Pastries, oils, salsas...I can't even remember it all.\n\nAnd that's just the tip of the iceberg. Get over here already.",

                "description": "There is no doubt in my mind that Soulard Farmer's Market is a treasure in the city of St. Louis! \n\nFirst Star: I can always find fresh produce. It's a combination of local and shipped in products sold by local vendors, and it's typically decently priced (bring cash, because not all vendors are set up for cards). There aren't as many organic producers as I would like, but you can find them. There are also meats, baked goods, and other fun non-food items. I love browsing the aisles and being inspired by my shopping finds. So I always bring a bag and fill 'er up!\n\nSecond Star: Nestled close to the Mississippi River, the market is rooted in St. Louis history. It can trace its beginnings back to the 18th century. Structurally built like old European \"H style\" markets (central core with four legs or wings for vendors), its origin was an open air field for farmers to sell produce, livestock, and dairy. Why shop in a new brick box store when you can wander the historical paths of Soulard?!?\n\nThird Star: Speaking of wandering, enjoy as you walk. Purchase a baked good from the several bakery spots, or grab a fresh made tamale. Imbibe with the hair of the dog that bit ya with a Bloody Mary, or sample a tasty bite if one of the vendors is offering. Grab a hot fresh mini-donut, or locally made pork rinds. They say you eat with your eyes first, and at Soulard you'll have the chance to see it and actually eat it while you shop!\n\nFourth Star: I love that you'll hear live music from the banjo players who seem to have a permanent residence at the end of one of the halls. You'll also be entertained by street performers from time to time and characters galore. It can get crowded on event weekends. So whether your vibe is to partake or avoid the crowds, you can check their website for updates. \n\nhttp://www.soulardmarket.com/soulard_market_002.htm\n\nWhich leads me to the Fifth Star:  It's a melting pot of fun people watching and interaction. You never know who (or what) you'll see! To me a visit to the market is like feeling the heartbeat of The Lou. So whether you're a local or a visitor, Soulard Farmer's Market has a lot to offer and is definitely worth the visit!",

I fancy myself a bit of a market connoisseur (meaning that you name a city I've been to and I've probably visited at least one of their local markets) and given Soulard's historic narrative, I was bummed to find Dole strawberries and knock off purses for sale. I imagined this market staying true to it's roots with 100% local products and vendors with an earthy \"I grew this in my back lot\" feel. \n\nThe market is quite expansive with two separate covered spaces offering shoppers everything from incense and soaps to mini doughnuts and overgrown zucchini. Next time, I'll probably wind up at another farmers market to find more of those MO-only products I was hoping for at Soulard. Worth a visit if you're visiting for history's sake.",

                "description": "The Soulard farmer's market is not incredible or amazing, but it's a very decent place to get some fresh produce. I'm very happy to find a solid farmer's market in St. Louis! \n\nPros: \n- Produce quality: Generally speaking, the quality is on par with what you would find in a grocery store. However, akin to choosing produce in the store, you have to know what to look for and be picky (in a good way)! Don't assume you'll automatically end up with good produce just because it's a farmer's market. \n- Vendors: If they're not in a hurry, I like to chat a little with the vendors to find out more about their business and to get to know the faces and stories behind the stalls. \n- Prices: Cheaper than a grocery store! \n\nRandom: You might want to walk through the whole thing first (it doesn't take too long) so you can make mental notes about the prices and quality of things you're thinking about buying in order to compare and get the best deal (money and quality-wise). \n\nCons: \n- Crowds: Depending on what time of day you go (the earlier the better), it can get pretty crowded pretty fast, especially with strollers, slow walkers (not the zombie kind), and inattentive kids who don't realize they're blocking the main path. \n- Parking: You might have to search a little, but it's not too bad. \n\nIn addition to the fruits and veggies available, there's an awesome looking spice store (I've never wanted to suck it up and wait in the long line/crowded store to actually buy something, though), several meat vendors, pastries, cheese, and even soaps. I would avoid the knock-off sunglasses and purses, though... those flea market feeling stalls aren't anything special. \n\nAll in all, a great experience! Make sure you bring cash and a reusable grocery bag!",

That's how awesome this place seemed to me.",

The staff has a plethora of suggestions and are more than willing to let you taste their mixes.  \n\nBring your own bag and cash - Some of the vendors take credit, but cash is easier and you don't want to take a chance.

Skip breakfast because starting off early here will give you the best chance to get some of the best produce before its picked over, however don't worry there are many options for breakfast snacking from mini donuts, to pastries, and even Bloody Marys that will help you enjoy the overall experience even more. \n\nThe more often you frequent the market you start to learn the insider tips, from which vendors offer the best deals. There really is no need to haggle here, because the prices are very fare however the market can get crowded, so be prepared. Be sure to bring cash, while some vendors take debit/credit many do not. Inside the market there is a spice shop and butcher shop, the butcher shop sells the usual items, however you can often find more exotic items, I noticed one trip that they were selling \"coon\", No thanks.\n\nBefore leaving Soulard I highly recommend making it a experience by stopping by Globe Drug and browse their selection of a little of everything, and no trip would be completed without finishing off your trip with Bogart's for some quality BBQ.Such a great experience, surprised 0t has taken me so long to write a review.",

First off, the people watching is first rate. Second, a 16 oz beer at the concession stand by the main entrance is only $2!  Really everything is cheap there.  My go-to food is the $1.25 hot dog with a giant ladling of chili for $1. \n\nOne interesting aspect of this market is how they don't really sell much locally grown food. Unless the Dole and Red Delicious family's live around STL and have several stalls setup here. Then there's nothing but homegrown produce. \nI'm not sure how the logistics of farm to market work but I figured I would see an old man dressed in overalls with a strand of wheat sticking out of his mouth selling his own batch of apples. \n\nMy favorite booth(not booze/sweets/chili dog related) is absolutely the meat booth with the high quality sliced turkey for $5.99 a pound. Schnucks sells comparably tasting Boar's Head turkey for $10.99 a pound. Boom...deals!\n\n\"Go for the produce, stay because you're getting buzzed\".  That's my Soulard Farmers Market motto.",

Everything was so cheap, fresh, delicious and LOCAL! \n\nI have my personal favorite vendors, but really, they're all amazing. They're more than willing to tell you all about their produce or just chit chat for a few minutes. I've yet to meet an unfriendly vendor.\n\nWhat sets this apart from normal grocery shopping? You can make a stop at their drink stand, order your beverage of choice (I do love a good bloody mary on Saturday morning) and make your rounds. Getting your groceries is so much more enjoyable with a delicious, cheap drink in your hand. \n\nI could go on and on about how phenomenal the Soulard Farmer's Market is, but you really have to experience it firsthand.

Sure, it will be more crowded, but the aura of the place and the unique people will make it more than worth it. \n\nThis is your typical farmer's market, with fresh produce, herbs, meat, and some various other \"household\" items like soaps and candles.\n\nYou will hear vendors trying to get your attention and yelling \"TOMATOES!,\" or \"STRAWBERRIES!\" louder than you've ever heard anyone yell the name of a vegetable or fruit before. \n\nBesides produce, you will run across a stall with livestock and animals like chickens, turkeys, and even bunnies all in the middle of the city. \n\nBefore long you will be trying to bargain with the vendors for the cheapest prices. Even later, you you will become a professional and do a complete walk through just to check out which vendor has the freshest produce with the best prices before buying. \n\nIf you get hungry while perusing, you can check out the multiple tiny food vendors that offer a delicious burst of energy. If you're craving something more sweet,  you can indulge in some of the pastries from the bakery in the middle of the market called \"Pekara.\"  Or if you're more in the mood for doughnuts, there's a tiny doughnut vendor where you will find yourself staring in amazement at the ingenuity of the machine that makes those tiny, cute doughnuts.  \n\nIf all of this doesn't convince you to come here, there's also alcohol.

Perhaps it's paying at so many different stands that discourages me from selecting everything that catches my eye. Moisturizing orange lotion, an herb, some fruit, and romaine lettuce filled my reusable bag. \n\nI was hungry when I arrived at Soulard this morning. This hunger plus a barking vendor led me to a slice of warm Dogtown cheese pizza (the first such purchase of the season, quoth barking vendor), an apricot and custard pastry, and lots of samples. You know what happens when I go to the grocery store while hungry? I buy three frozen pizzas and a bunch of other stuff I eat while the pizza heats up. Soulard inspires me to buy and eat healthy. \n\nThe downside to Soulard is how busy it is on pleasant days at mid-morning. At times, it's difficult to walk. You'll bump into people, and people will bump into you. I prefer earlier in the morning or later in the afternoon when some vendors drop prices.",

This place has everything!! Produce, meat, fancy confections, wood chips for smoking meat, hand-knit gloves and hats, fresh baked bread, fresh doughnuts and the list goes on and on! I look forward to going back sometime soon and really spending time there and treating myself to some goodies!",

Saturday is the best day to visit this market although it is open Wednesdays through Saturdays. \n\nIt's great for people watching, listening to street musicians, fruits/veg, plants, flowers, bloody Marys,  meats, spices, hot donuts, and much more. \n\nSome vendors sell produce that's isnt top notch but as a regular, I know to avoid these sellers. \n\nVery friendly people here.",

                "description": "This was my first trip to the Farmers Market and boy was it an adventure?!\n\nI wasn't sure what to think when I first walked in.  The smell of produce and meats filled the air, and for the most part made me hungry as we walked thru the market.  I was immediately upset that we didn't pack more than six dollars in cash for the stop, but it was unplanned to say the least.  We were in the area to look at bikes, but when the bike shop was unexpectedly closed, my wife convinced me that a walk through the market could be fun.\n\nSo, with no cash to really spend, we were destined to just be window shoppers, right?  Not necessarily.  Thanks to iphones and the Square app, several vendors were able to take our debit card and we were able to bring home a few little goodies.  A friend of ours found out we were there and he came by as well, and we got to see him in action as he bought a weeks worth of produce, including several dozen apples for a dessert he was making for a party he was attending later that day, all on a $20 bill.  (he even splurged to buy a gooey butter cake from the bakery just so we could try it)  \n\nAll in all, the Soulard Farmers Market left quite an impression.  Grocery shopping is such a drag no matter where I go, and the SFM is more than a 30 minute drive for us, however, between the prices at Whole Foods and the lines at Shop N Save, the experience and the savings (not to mention the healthier alternatives to canned cooking) I think the SFM might be the best option for the wife and I.  It is a day out, time well spent, etc.  \n\nI look forward to our next trip, and hope to make it a regular one to boot!",

I will walk in, go directly to the Spice Shop, get what I want, and then walk straight out.\n\nBe a tourist for a day and go just for the sake of saying you have been.

The market has everything I could ever want when visiting a farmer's market. I love how I can go here with a $20 and come out with 2 giant tote bags filled with produce, bread, and sometimes pasta! \n\nThe more I go visit the better I get at knowing which vendor to buy from. I also found my new favorite vendor-the potato guy! He literally sells potatoes and that's it. I purchased a few sweet potatoes from him (he even offered a white sweet potato). I think he grows them in his own personal garden or something because they were dirty and roots were still attached, but whoa, they were the best tasting potatoes I have ever had. No lie. \n\nI am thankful to have such a great farmer's market in the area and I will continue to support it as long as I live here.",

Multiple farms set up their own booths and display their goods, and their prices are so much better than any store! I would recommend looking at multiple booths before buying because their prices may be slightly differently, usually only by about 5-10 cents. I've gotten half a pound of mushrooms for a dollar, 5 red bell peppers for $2,  4 bananas for 40 cents, a zucchini for 55 cents, and potatoes for 85 cents per pound. I've been here twice, and both times, I didn't spend over $20. I normally would spend at least $30 for a week's worth of groceries at a grocery store. There's also a booth that sells hand made pasta, which are infused with different flavors, and it's $5 for a bunch, which was about 4 servings for me after adding other toppings. The greatest part about their pasta is that you just don't have to add sauce because there's already so much flavor in the pasta. You can just cook it and add some butter or olive oil and some toppings. \n\nI definitely recommend coming here if you have to go grocery shopping in St. Louis!!",

Apples are usually $1/lb but they were offering $1 for 2lbs and they were selling boxes of berries for really low price too.  Even heard a vendor trying to get rid of their vegetables by offering them in bunches.  Awesome.\n\nThere's also a butcher shop selling the usual, along with items a little more odd to me.  Wild game like biso and 'coon, as well as shark steaks and alligator.  Yes, racoons.  Wonder how that taste...?\n\nThere's a spice market inside and it smells amazing.  Saw a bunch of hipsters there buying cinnamon sticks. \n\nThere's also vendors selling items like clothing, incense, and soap.  We stopped by a vendor that sold soap and got two bars just to support to local vendors.  Didn't hurt that the soap had really unique combination of fragrances haha.\n\nCloses fairly late for a farmers market and they don't open on Sundays.",

                "description": "To basically repeat what Kat V. wrote...\n\nYou can't get local produce from our \"local\" farmer's market. It frustrates me that vendors will buy their produce from one single whole saler and then resell it to you. They just purchase the food to sell at a higher price to the public. It's a complete sham and bullshit! I think if you're going to be local, then sell your local items. \n\nI went home last weekend to TN and got real LOCAL produce. The farmers themselves were selling what they grew. Their own crops, their own meat, their own breads that they made. I hate the \"fall off the back of the truck\" type sales. You can see the difference in the quality of food versus what was home grown. Plus if you don't eat what you purchase immediately, it will go bad. Think shelf life of 2 days max. Soulard Market has a lot of that.\n\nI like the historical significance of the market itself and the fact that it has such a vast selection of items. However, why I would I make a special trip here to get \"local\" produce when it's not their food and it is upcharged. If I want organic, I will go to Whole Foods or even Schnuck's. \n\nIt really does disappoint me. It doesn't meet my expectations, and I didn't think my expectations were that high to want quality grown food from a farmer's market.",

As City as it gets...and for a reason.  This is the original. I have been going here for geez...45 years (with my dad when I was little).  \nAlways pick your own produce...and ask to see what is high up in the stand...not what is right in front of you  (a tip from my Dad from years ago)\n\nThis is the true deal.  Don't hesitate to barter here...on anything.  Don't buy the first thing you see produce wise.  There are tons of options.  We love it for the produce, seafood and flower prices are great You can get STL touristy stuff as well\n\nIt is just a great place to go and visit...wether you are buying for th week or just going for the experience.  We love the kettle corn for sure.  Usually get a bloody Mary when we walk in...how much better can it get than a cocktail while you shop.  Last week we got some great Andouille sausage for some gumbo!\n\nIn the day...my dad would take me to Soulard first and then to Missouri Bakery on the hill for the bread for the week.  Some many great things to see and its all so close\n\nAnd you are supporting local farmers.  Don't forget to hit Bogarts for some great BBQ when you leave or hit one of the great other restaurants in the area.",

                "description": "I had heard mixed reviews of this farmer's market and admittedly, when I first heard of it, it was about 2~3 years ago and I had vowed to one day go there. As my interest in cooking my own meals fluctuated with the months during my college years, I finally opted to check the place out. But I never did. WHY?! WHY DID I NOT GO? \n\nFast forward to today. I am leaving the Yelp gathering in Clayton when I suddenly recall as I am driving back toward I-170S ramp that I had seen white tents being set up and remember seeing a sign about Clayton farmer's market which opened at 8:30am. After a brief stop there, I was feeling a little unfulfilled. That's when I decided to plug into my GPS thing the Soulard Farmer's Market address. I crossed my fingers, and then proceeded toward highway 44E. When I finally got off the ramp at 7th street, I was little nervous. Saturday almost-afternoon at Soulard Farmer's market? Parking is going to be a f**king NIGHTMARE!\n\nUgggh.\n\nSo I made a snap decision to make a right on Lafayette and I am SO glad I did. Literally 3 cars were leaving their metered spots at once. I waited patiently with my signal on until I scored the spot. AND the meter even had over 1.45 hours on it! Holy crap. The Powers That Be hath smiled upon me today!\n\nWalked over to the market with my reusable grocery tote in hand and determination. Realized how effing big the place was. Started to freak out a little because the high today was supposed to go up to 99 degrees and all they had was a fan going. Luckily it was still morning-ish and not too hot. \n\nSaw Cherie O's review about $5 bouquets of roses so I immediately made a beeline for the florist. I thought maybe there might be more than one florist here...so maybe I shouldn't buy anything right away if I see it. Went inside florist and realized the bouquets were actually $8 or $9 which still isn't bad but I don't think it was a dozen roses either. EDIT: they are sold by \"Pat\" near the petshop.\n\nI didn't really *need* roses but they smell and look nice and when you're done you can use them for other things like dropping them in a warm bucket of water for a foot soak (the natural oils in the petals will soothe your feet!)\n\nDecided it was time to check out the produce. Noticed an amazing-looking spice shop but it was PACKED wall to wall with people. Jesus Christ. I decided to avoid.\n\nHeaded down first aisle, and realized this place reminds me of the Daytona Beach Flea Market (not a compliment, BTW.) Saw a HUGE looking carrot for only about 50 cents at one stand, so I bought it along with a HUGE squash. This stuff can't be naturally grown...can it? Only genetic altering can yield such a massive vegetable! Also I suspected a lot was not grown here as some things were clearly marked with labels stating \"grown in California!\"\n\nKept walking down the aisle and found a booth with fresh cherries. 1lb for $3. The cherries ended up not tasting as sweet as I'd hoped but still not too bad of a deal. \nAlso found some peaches that looked really gorgeous at another for $1.50. Wow! A buck fitty for about 6 delicious looking peaches? Count me in.\n\nI kept on moving until I got to a place selling seafood. Looked uber sketchy and the shrimp smelled rancid every time the guy opened the cooler but I noticed a frozen lobster tail for $7.99 and it looked sizable. So I opted for that. I cooked it tonight and ate it with fresh drawn butter and lemon juice. Soooo tasty and very very easy to prepare. But the amount of meat was still really too small to make a meal of it. Damn lobster being so expensive. But it was okay. I wouldn't have touched the other fish that guy was selling. If it was frozen, maybe.\n\nThere was also a pet shop with cute looking animals but it looked really grungy and the smell was about enough to send me into a sneezing oblivion. Somehow I feel like this would be a place to incite anger in uber-crazy-animal-loving-people. You know the kind who work at shelters who so much as snap at you if you look at a dog or cat with the evil eye. LOL yeah. You know what I'm trying to say here.\n\nMoving along, I wanted to buy an avocado but no one seemed to be selling. I asked a random stand just to see if they had any, and he paused for a moment and said, \"well, yeah....we have some...in crates in the truck...let me get a couple for you.\" I told him I only needed to buy one, but he returned with two avocados and gave them to me for free. FOR FREE. Cheap as free! But I didn't notice until I got home that they were rotten. EW. WTF?! Why would he even do that? I guess maybe he thought they still might be salvageable? \n\nAnyway I think I would return to get cheap produce but that's about it. Nothing else seemed to be screaming \"bargain\" unless maybe the prices are reduced everywhere on Sunday. I didn't even go down the aisles with clothing.\n\nAlso does anyone find it disturbingly hilarious that the meat/butcher shop has a sign saying \"LOOK FOR PET SHOP IN AISLE X\" ?! I mean, really..WTF",

We even picked up some kale to try for the first time!  \nI did think it would be a bit bigger with more meat and fish selections.  We went on Saturday afternoon and didn't see too much else other than produce but that was not a big deal for us.\nI agree with others, bring your own bags and have your dollar bills ready when purchasing to save time.  Oh, and leave the animals at home!  \nWill choose the market over the big grocery store any time even if the produce isn't from local farmers.",

We encountered a National Park guard today, an older man with white hair, and he questioned us about our medical seizure dog to the point of harassment. Besides clearly violating federal law in his questions and statement in front of a group of people that he was certain this was not a service dog. Our service dog wears a red vest and has clear patches on the vest indicating he is a medical alert dog. This is not required by Federal law, but I do so to educate others about service animals. I asked the guard if he would like to see his paperwork I keep in the zipper pocket of his vest, he ignored me and kept saying he wasn't a service dog. People in the crowd started saying things to the guard and he finally walked away. We had made multiple purchases, we were carrying bags, I was trying to purchase more produce when he approached us, and instead of continuing, I asked my husband to leave. I know it is not the vendors fault, but this man needs to retire, and I will not return after shopping in this market for over 20 years.",

I used to come here as a kid with my mother, and we always bought produce here if my grandmother didn't bring us anything from her garden on the farm in Illinois. \n\nAfter I spent time at the Hispanic Festival, I decided to check it out since it's been so long since I was there. I am planning on going more often. It was crowded since it was in the afternoon, but I had fun going up and down the different sections of the market looking at what they have to offer. \n\nI bought a pound of raw Brazil nuts from one of the vendors there; it surprised me that they had them since I have not seen them for a long. long time. I bought a pound of Brussels sprouts and a head of Romaine lettuce which I needed. \n\nIt's a good place to watch people and buy produce that is less expensive than the grocery stores for the most part. \n\nI think that I am going to go more often but earlier on a Saturday or on a Friday when it's not so crowded like it was today. \n\nParking today was horrifically bad, but the market was open and the Hispanic Festival was today, so that's probably why.",

I am also having a torrid love affair with Baetje Farms goat cheese (http://baetjefarms.com/).  Seriously, if you haven't tried their garlic and chive coeur de creme yet, cough up the $8 next time you're at the market and try it.  You'll love it.  \n\nFinally, I've noticed certain sellers are starting to advertise the fact that their food is locally produced (I can't remember the name of their booth, but one family has a giant \"Locavores Welcome\" banner above their stand.  Their fresh asparagus in late May is the best I've ever had).  If you pay attention to the details, it becomes more obvious which booths are selling wholesale produce and which are local farmers.  \n\nSo yeah, set your Saturday alarm clock for early, pack your reusable bags and get going to the market!",

Hell, take the morning off. Get there early. Get the good stuff. Have some friendly conversations with the vendors. Maybe even haggle a little. But not too much. Don't be that guy.

Check.\n\nWe went relatively early on a Sunday (10ish). We easily found parking within a block of the market, and I didn't think it was that crowded. You just gotta go with the flow and know what you want. You can't stand there for ten minutes debating if you want to buy a 3 cent apple or not.

My only complain is that sometimes there are panhandlers and solicitors in the parking lots and it takes away from the quaint nature of the farmers market.",

Soulard's market is terrific; the vendors are incredibly nice--one man gave my an extra pepper that was bigger than my hand, just because I talked food with him. The venue is clean and the stands are set up nicely; bringing your own bags is a great idea and make sure your arms are ready for a little bit of a work out if you're not shopping for just a few key items. \n  I enjoy coming here because it really does make a difference eating fresh, organic foods (and helps the farmers as well!) I got amazing honey on my most recent visit along with delicious, ripe, ginormous granny smith apples. Each time I come here I am more and more impressed with the quality and quantity that these vendors present for us. \n      Their small shops at the hub section of the venue are so unique (love walking through here and smelling all the diverse blends!) From ice cream to spices, they have a row of little shops to fit your needs, and I could sit around and people watch with a waffle cone in hand for hours! \n        I can't thumbs up this place enough--but really--so wonderful.",

I enjoy the vitality of the crowd and the variety of produce found here.\n\nHaving said that - I must say there is a recurring problem with produce bought here, and it doesn't matter the vendor.  It is not always fresh. Things like berries, bananas, green peppers, all went bad in like two days.   Apples and pears seemed to last longer.  I can only assume they buy the excess time sensitive produce that grocers are not willing to buy. \n\nI prefer to buy my produce from a farmer's roadside stand, where it is both fresh and ripe.

OK, I won't guarantee the quality, but it's cheap, and in most cases, you can look over the veggies carefully before you buy.  Keep an eye out for a reputable vendor - they are definitely there, anbd for me, they're kind of easy to spot.  \n\nIf you are looking for a place that's vibrant, this is the answer.   The poeple watching is tremendous and just checking out the different items for sale is worth the effort.  I love the way this market has pretty much avoided gentrification.  It hasn't changed much since I was a kid.   I saw another reviewer describe it as \"pretty nice\" but I wouldn't use those words...it's a little gritty.\n\nTips:  avoid it on warm and muggy days - too crowded and the veggies don't like it.  Also don't go if you're afraid of navigating crowds.   Beware of vendors trying to slip you a bag of lesser product from behind the booth.",

I know! \n\nKaren G. and I visited a few months ago, mostly to wander the stands and snap pictures like tourists. But until this past weekend, I hadn't actually purchased anything from the market (unless that $1 jello shot counts? YES, they have jello shots at the market! Crazy, right?). \n\nAnyway, I arrived around 2pm on Saturday. Enough time for the major crowds to dissipate, but not so late that everything was picked over. And late enough in the afternoon to haggle! I recommend coming at this time to score some sweet deals. \n\nWhat kind of sweet deals, you ask? How about 7 pounds of Gala apples for 5 bucks? Or three HUGE bunches of kale for $3? 5 pounds of sweet potatoes for $3? Or maybe the five HUGE cucumbers I purchased for only one buck? \n\nI was like a kid in a candy store. It was quite amazing, and I'm super thrilled with the quality of the produce I picked up. If I had more hands (or one of those nifty carts I saw the regulars pushing around) I would have stocked up on more. \n\nThis was my first experience at Soulard, but it most definitely won't be the last.",

                "description": "Ok. So here's the deal. I like people. I mean... I really, really like people. I really, really hate crowds though. So I avoid anytime after 9 on Saturday at Soulard. Some things you should know about the market:\n\n*The earlier you go, the better the produce (duh)\n*About half of these marketers are reselling grocery-store produce. Look around at everyone's merchandise before you buy. \n*Some vendors accept credit cards. Most don't. Bring cash.\n*I find the best merchants on the lower right leg of the H. \n*Do NOT bring your small children here. It can be a long walk, and there can be spontaneously thick crowds. \n*You will save a ton of money on your produce, and it is far better quality.\n*You will save a ton of money on meat, and it is far better quality.\n*You will NOT save money on bread or pasta, but again, yummy.\n*You will break about even with cheeses/eggs, and some of them are waaay better than store bought. \n*This is a great spot for tourist shopping if you like open air markets.\n\nI think that actually may sum it up for me. \n\nI get distracted in Soulard with all the yummies and shineys, and always wish I had brought a much bigger backpack with me. My favorite deal this Saturday had to be 4 huge, beautiful yellow squash for a buck. I practically squealed with delight.\n\nOther random tips:\nBring something to haul produce in. I bring a backpack, but people bring totes and little carts. Strollers work, too.\nPlease bring reusable cloth bags. C'mon. It isn't that hard, or that big of  deal. \nPark across the street in the bank parking lot. Otherwise you're going to be walking.\nPlan extra time to listen to awesome music.",

The produce here as far as I have seen is always fresh and the prices are amazing. I would suggest bringing cash because a lot of the vendors do not accept cards. There are multiple booths that sell food for you to eat while shopping and all of them have really good food. The hours here are pretty great but I would suggest going pretty early in the morning to beat out the crowds for the best produce OR a little before they close to get some deals on items. I always buy my bread later in the day because the guy that sells the bread always marks it down in price at the end of the day by a couple of dollars. The meat here in the butcher shop is pretty well priced as well and the quality is outstanding. This is a great place to people watch as well. All kinds of people show up to this market. They do quite a few events here on the weekends as well so you can check out their Facebook page to see what they have going on. This is a really great place. I will continue to go back.",

                "description": "I love waking up early on spring and summer Saturday mornings and heading down to the Soulard Farmer's Market. There's not a whole lot to this open air market; it's basically an awning with vendors underneath it, but I get a great sense of community every time I head to the farmer's market. I like seeing familiar and new faces week after week; happy with their fresh vegetables, fruit, and flowers, thinking of what they're going to do with it all.\n\nI've been coming to the Soulard Farmer's Market for about three years now and I've never had a bad experience with a vendor (sure some are more talkative and friendly than others), bought a bad piece of fruit/vegetation (I'm fairly certain these vendors are meticulous about what they set out), or felt bad when I left. This is a great, leisurely way to spend a Saturday morning, and if you venture out, I'm sure I'll see you there.",

It's a place that everyone needs to visit at least once...just to see the atmosphere and people. And it's where a savvy shopper can get a lot of fresh produce for almost next to nothing. Definitely stroll around first and get a feel for what is available before you buy. Some produce is fresher than others so be sure to double check before you purchase. And sometimes, as it gets closer to the end of the day, the vendors will go down on the price. Definitely check out the meat market...the weisswurst is pretty good...and the spice shop, which probably has every spice known to man for relatively cheap prices, along with flavorful coffees.

Not only that, but they buy the produce that's past its prime and that would otherwise end up in Dumpsters.\n\n- I can get fresher, cheaper produce at Aldi's without the crowds, the parking headaches, the bad smells, the drive, and the heat.\n\n- I discovered one of the vendors I trusted routinely added up my order wrong, always in her favor.\n\n- Unlike at stores, you can't choose your produce. The vendors almost always slip a few rotten pieces in the bottom of the bag.\n\n- Even if you've been their customer for years, some vendors are just plain rude and unpleasant. One particularly bad offender is George Simon. Even though he is a sub-deacon at St. Raymond's, he's profane and treats his customers like dirt.",

                "description": "I am such a huge fan of this place.  I was deterred for a while due to some of the low-star reviews some people have given it.  After visiting a few times, I do see why some of the cons were listed, but it still doesn't make me stop yearning to go every weekend! \n\nIt does get crowded, but this doesn't bother me - I actually really enjoy the hustle and bustle.  Adds a nice vibe to the experience.  I agree that it is hard to distinguish local produce from wholesale produce.  But you can always just ask.  I've never had an issue with parking and I've always gone on a Saturday morning...I just park a couple blocks away, south of the market, and walk.\n\nI do have a complaint that some of the produce doesn't look very fresh.  But, there are so many vendors, that I can just walk to another vendor and find the same thing at better quality. \n\nThe produce is SO cheap that sometimes I feel like I should throw in an extra buck or two as to not rip anyone off. \n\nDairy and meat vendors are there too, but I haven't tried them.  I'm really not a dairy and meat type of gal, so I probably never will.  But a couple of my friends are really into buying stuff from those vendors because you can find some craaaaazy stuff: rabbit, raccoon, quail, goat, etc.  No thanks...but I hope someone else enjoys them!\n\nOne of my favorite vendors sells packaged food, such as wild rice, couscous, steel cut oats, quick oats, dried fruits, etc.  The wild rice is absolutely delicious and has such a great flavor!  I also tried the couscous with cranberries.  It's good too, but has a pretty intense, salty taste.  \n\nI enjoy seeing the random items that are being sold...Cardinal's memorabilia, sunglasses, purses, beautiful flowers, pets, bamboo (I bought some!!), etc.  \n\nYou can even buy food to eat while walking around - I have sworn to myself that I will go to the market hungry next time in order to partake in these delicious looking items!  Oh and alcoholic beverages are there too! \n\nGive this place a chance - even if you don't like it, you're sure to remember it.  There's a reason it's famous!",

Like previous reviews stated, there was a lack thereof of local produce.  When I think of farmer's market, I think of local produce & not produce from other states &/or countries.  I get that somethings just doesn't grow well here.  As other people have said, get up early to beat the crowds & get the fresh er fresher produce.  This market isn't that big.  There are some good deals (like $17.89 (methinks) a pound on rack of New Zealand lamb from the meat market).  Look closely at the produce or you can get ripped off.  That was my mistake.  Sometimes, it is much better to get some produce at the grocery store or at either Sam's Club or Costco.  Would I come back here, maybe but only for the rack of lamb, maybe a couple of plants &  maybe some dried locally made pasta & some bread.",

Because it seemed the majority of vendors weren't offering homegrown goods but stuff shipped in from elsewhere. Well, wtf? Okay, I get that it's early in the season, but that's no excuse for such low quality products. I couldn't believe some of the produce they were trying to get people to buy - the garbage can was the only place some of their goods belonged.\n\nIn addition, the setup of the market is far from conducive to any sort of crowd - because it's so small it's difficult to walk through and absolutely no air is ventilated through the long hallways. On an 85 degree day, that is NOT the way I want to spend my time.\n\nThe one highlight of the trip was our purchase from Baetje Farms - their sign announces fresh goat cheese made weekly, and based on the taste test of their offerings, it was obvious that they know what they're doing. It was some of the best cheese I've ever tasted. We ended up with the cranberry and cinnamon concoction as well as the garlic and chive version. With crackers, it made for a fabulous evening snack. I highly recommend seeking them out if you opt to visit this market - may just be the only highlight of your visit too.",

But, as for the rest of the market...ehhh...\n\nFirst the pros:\n\n1) Bloody Marys available at multiple locations.  Win.\n\n2) There's another meat vendor that has wicked awesome Canadian bacon.  Seriously, it's incredible.  Next time we go, I'll verify the vendor's name.\n\n3) Pet store - yeah, it stinks at times, but when they have kittens or bunnies in the window, it's nice to stop and see some cute meat, er, animals.\n\n4) Flowers - there's an awesome flower place in there too which a great selection\n\n5) Prices - you will definitely save money on your produce...but....\n\nCons:\n\n1) Produce - we apparently have the worse luck in the world.  Basically any produce we buy, if not used within two days, ends up going bad.  This includes things from locals and wholesalers.  It has gotten to the level that we buy the meats and spices only here.  Sort of defeats the purpose of a farmers market.\n\n2) Fellow human beings - this is not the place to go if you have in innate hatred of those that have no concept there are others in the world.  Groups of 3-4 people standing in the middle of the aisle chatting and slowing down foot traffic?  Check.  Parents with their uber babymobile clipping your heel?  Check.\n\n3) Counterfeit/knockoff items - I don't give two craps that your purses or sunglasses have the disclaimer that they are \"inspired by\" a certain designer.  They're effing knockoffs.  Seriously, get this crap out of here.  I would rather have stalls filled with tropical items in February than see one more \"Goach\" bag.  (And no, my wife didn't make me write this part, I just can't stand seeing it)\n\nThere's a bunch of other good things here, but there are enough disappointments that I can't overlook.",

The $4 Bloody Mary's are a must. The selection of produce was ok, I'll be anxious to see what it is like later in the season. I was looking for a good selection of local farmers/vendors and didn't really find it. There were too many people selling fruit and vegetables from California or Mexico. They looked pretty fresh, but I came for local food. The florist in the center had a great selection of boquets and overall the deals on produce were extremely reasonable, so I will definitely be back.",

We only take $20 cash and make it stretch for some fruit but mainly romaine, carrots, fresh cilantro, ginger, etc. Add in $4 bouquet of lillies and a loaf of asiago bread (perfect for grilling bruschetta) my $20 goes pretty far here :) the meats ur not really getting a deal on...nor the fish...yeah just stick to produce here. Do know as the day goes by almost every vendor jacks up their prices so be warned! Otherwise stay out the way and bargain ur veggies!",

                "description": "Saturday morning....\n The crowds congregate, blend, form... here in St Louis... 9th and Vincent... Soulard. The spawn of the Farmer's market... a convergence, a flickering sepia-past, the holler of old immigrants, the merchants. I stand before the deluge of the crowd passing through tired entrance markers. The day is hot, and the whistle of the open air market hollows through the rows of stands. Her French roots have awoken, alive for the morning, a return to history... glistening... forming. The spice shops echo of the French Quarter... New Orleans... Americana. The colors vivid, penetrating, fruits, vegetables, red, green, yellow, orange, and the low dim of the overhead light flickering in the shade of canopies. The swinging of weight scales all working together like clockwork, feeding the rhythm. Spoken are the languages of merchants, channeling the old roar of immigrants...here they assemble; history is united. \nThe crowd pulsates, moving to an urban rhythm, flowing through the aisles like the Big Muddy. Alive are the blues, eminent, I see it in the eyes of the musicians. Ragged they situate, their stories alive again in old rags. \n I venture to the pasta stands, greeted by an Italian vendor. Her smile a pearly white, her hair, a contrasting onyx. Sweat softly streams about her face, the exchange is made. A flickering memory of old Italia. Her accent, a thick St Louisian. Her story is revealed. The chapters continue, her story, their story...our story.....assemble.... The chattering of old walkers, canes, and baby carriages, navigating their way through the confusion, the energy. \nLost in the fold I succumb to the end of the route, met by the familiar mold of the current. The arch is visible again. Defiant and silent in the distance it appears in my eyes. The concrete city, jagged, etched by the mammoth highway, and slowly the holler of the farmer's market whispers away. Fading...the energy concludes; dissipating into the soft hours of the afternoon.  And the now the agora is barren till next Saturday, ready to spring fresh...anew........again.",

                "description": "My budget is seriously thanking me since I started doing the majority of my grocery shopping at Soulard Farmers Market. It's been around a year since I first came to Soulards and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. Usually Saturdays are my only options to go so my boyfriend and I get some cash, our reusable shopping bags and head over. The parking lot is very useful because although it's not free, you can pay by the hour and they accept credit cards which is pretty sweet. The only time I have ever had a difficult time finding a spot is around 12pm on the Saturdays that it's super nice and everyone is flocking to the farmers market. Once parked we usually hit up the concession stand for a bud light....shopping for veggies while drinking a beer? You got it right  \n\nIt gets super busy on Saturdays but I always go in generally knowing what I'm looking for which seems to help calm some of the sense of chaos in the atmosphere and allow me to enjoy perusing to find the best deal and highest quality items. You will find a wide range of prices and quality so you will be the happiest if you are able to take the time to browse and the more I go the more I remember specific stands that provide the highest quality. My favorite farmers market moment was when I got 5 pounds of potatoes for $1. I LOVE potatoes...potato salad, mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, potato soup...you name it and I couldn't believe I got such a good deal. I almost felt like I was robbing them of their product. I am also usually able to find a good deal on romaine lettuce, strawberries, onions, bananas, etc. Besides those basics, I always have to visit the mushroom man. He sells the best, most flavorful organic shitake mushrooms I have ever had. I am seriously addicted. My visit is never complete without visiting the meat stand, their meat prices are outstanding and the bacon is probably some of the best I have ever had in my life. Best advice I would have is to not buy from the first stand you see but instead take a little bit of time and find the best products...also if you take the time to go out there, do yourself a favor and walk over to Bogarts afterwards for some lunch after shopping. Makes for an awesome afternoon.",

The experience is fun especially if you go there in the morning. Good snack food here and there while you're browsing around. Try those little donuts inside the market (forgot what it's called)  and it is really delicious. I am not sure because we haven't tried but I'm pretty sure you can negotiate the prices on just about any meat and vegetables they offer especially if you buy in bulk. Hope this helps. Bring cash as their ATM sometimes does not work plus it gives you more bargaining power. Overall fun experience.",

History alone makes Soulard Farmers Market a very cool place indeed (not to mention that the land on which it sits was donated by a woman named Julia, and we ALL know how cool Julias are).\n\nI visited the market on a Friday morning and am reserving further judgment for a weekend visit when the stalls are apparently all full.  That's not to say there weren't plenty of options on a weekday--fresh produce, herbs and flowers abound in the outdoor stalls, while the indoor portion of the market houses a lovely spice shop (it also sells artisanal cheeses and some meats), a bakery, a few butchers (some even had boudin, which I rarely see outside of Louisiana) and a fish stall that I hear is totally phenomenal.  I'm looking forward to visiting the fish guy the next time we're in town.\n\nAll the produce we bought for dinner that night was wonderful and I liked the old-school feel to the market.  One thing grossed me out, though--there's this one stall that's pretty out of the way (thank goodness) and I guess it's a pet store.  It has loads of bunnies that I think were crammed a bit too close together and pigeons for sale for $5.50.  I thought I'd see what else they had, but it smelled so strongly of dirty zoo that I had to pass it by quickly.  Yucko.  Skip the weirdo pet store and stick with the spice shop.  It smells MUCH better.",

I made several well priced buys here. Meat market shop enclosed looked and smelled like a very good butcher shop. This place could use a fresh fish market.

                "description": "We're going to go ahead and chalk this up as a 3.5 star review (I round up). There's much to love at Soulard Market...be warned though, if you hate crowds and noise, just don't go. \nI've read a few of the other reviews and while I agree with some of the comments regarding local produce, I do have some things to say to that. My wife and I did notice this past Saturday that there are quite a few vendors selling wholesale-bought produce, yes...BUT, there are those farmers in the rough who actually bring you their goods straight from the farm and sell it to you cheap, you just have to be on the look-out. That one point makes things hard though, I wish the farmers that are local and grow their own stuff would advertise that a little better...there was only one stall that actually had a huge banner saying 'locavores welcome!' and they backed it up with awesome produce. Otherwise, you have to just use some common sense. Usually, if there's a sticker on the fruit, it's not local. Also, there's always the tried and true method of just ASKING where they get their produce. What? Talk to people? Oh man...what a concept. Another note...we live in the midwest. Shocker, I know...but we do. With that, that means that we have certain produce that is local, and some that just cannot be. Pineapple? Not grown here. Neither is mango. And nope...cherries aren't either. So I say, while you're there buying the locally grown stuff...go ahead and pick up the stuff that you will NEVER find grown locally...and don't complain about it, because it's one stop shopping. Be smart...some things you have to buy shipped in, it's just where we live. \nWe were able to buy locally and for the whole week for just under $20...which is amazing. Soulard also sells a ton of meat, eggs, dairy, cheese...but we didn't really hit that up so I can't comment. Though, we had the mini-doughnuts which were like tiny funnel cakes (and made in a tiny fryer!!). We've also enjoyed the bloody mary/beignet combo on the west side of the market...that was a great day. :) \nThe market is a vibrant part of St. Louis...both for shopping and culture. Music playing, food cooking, people buying their groceries for the week. We need Soulard...ST. Louis needs Soulard...go to Soulard even if it's just to buy some mini doughnuts.",

The one thing that they do not have on the KC farmers market is a spice stand. They do however have some great garlic that is already peeled and ready for cooking! What we can get at the grocery store for $30 doesn't even amount to what we can get at the Farmers Market. Because these veggies are not treated with anything I do notice that they do go bad sooner than normal veggies from the store would but thankfully we go through them very fast. This is a great place to wheel and deal for some good food. Make sure you go early on Saturday before all of the good stuff is gone but be ready for a large crowd by 10:30 or sooner!

You can get produce dirt cheap here, but the key is walking thru the whole place a couple times before you start buying things. You can usually find it cheaper somewhere else. First and foremost don't let the vendors pick your stuff. Often they put their best stuff out on display and when they lure you in then they throw in their old stuff when they bag it. Also the cheap thing is good, but when I take the time to cook, its a lot of effort so I go for QUALITY. That is what makes this place so great. Go early, go early, go early. Especially on Saturday. Take a cart, or a box, and maybe a cooler with ice if you're really stocking up.  I got a Gus' pretzel with a bratwurst inside of it. Very tasty. I also really like the bloody Mary's at the northeast wing comes with a green bean, celery, lime, olive, and some cajun spice thats right on.

The hot links and the Andouille sausage from the shop that had Coon We also grabbed a  german garlic dog on the way out and holy cow it was good, a little brown mustard a little ketchup it was like a mothers kiss.....if your mother was a spicy German collection of ground meats.",

                "description": "Peoples' reviews show they're more knowledgeable about farmers' markets, but sometimes they're not paying attention at Soulard.  There are definitely local farmers  - who offer wonderfully fresh produce and herbs, including more unusual ones like bay leaves, fennel, and Japanese spinach (tatsoi?) in season - also the local goat cheesemaker (the Provencal variety is fabulous!); poultry, egg and butter sellers; the mushroom man, who arranges his offerings like still lifes; pastas in a great variety of flavors, with tasty recipes attached to the bag; Kaldi's coffees; Black Bear Bakery, a local coop.  \n\nOf course some distributors sell produce they got at the wholesale market, especially when local produce is not in season.  Take advantage of what's there.",

                "description": "My first experience here was when I was 6yrs old. It was a weekly trip I took with my grandparents. Amazing how we lose connections with the things of our past as we grow old. I went here Sat. morning for the 1st time in many years. Not much has changed...brought back many memories. I would suggest getting there about 7am-8am to get really good stuff but don't buy from the first vendor you meet...walk through and look at all the produce because sometimes you might find it a little cheaper down the line. There is an awesome spice house on the inside that is open year round, they also sell a variety of flavored coffee beans you can have ground for that fresh coffee smell. :) ....there is also a meat market on the inside as well. They even sell beef ribs! Only downside I have with this place....they are not open on Sundays.....so get up early on Sat. and take a trip to Soulard. If you are a fan of pork rinds,,, there is a vendor setup in the front of the market making fresh, fried pork rinds with a variety of flavors...$3.00 a bag for you fans of this snack food. Hey guys..... or gals....you can buy fresh flowers really cheap here also....$5 for a bouquet of roses!",

He really enjoyed talking to the vendors, who were small businessmen who bought and sold produce. I don't think it was ever a true farmers' market where the producers sold their own goods. Some day maybe I'll get back and visit it.",
