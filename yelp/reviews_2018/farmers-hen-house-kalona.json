            "description": "An egg review. Seriously.  Farmer's Hen House are the best eggs we have found outside of gathering yourself. Eggs start and complete so many recipes. A fried egg over just about anything tastes sublime.\n\nThree years into buying FHH eggs and we are loyal. (AND secretly hope that I get a carton full of double yolks! - it happens.)  For approx $3.20 a dozen they are a steal.\n\nDuring the egg recall, FHH had their website ready with large header that stated proudly: Our Eggs Are Not Involved with the Recall.  \n\nI looked forward to my daily egg  w/ zataar on sourdough before the recall but after reading about how local they really are, the care and practice compared to the $3.20 we pay -- our fam is dialed in.",
