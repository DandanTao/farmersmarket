            "description": "It's end of the season and there are still some great looking vegetables, flowers and more. This is a nice quiet time to get some great buys. \n\nI like the small size of this farmer's market. It's accessible by train. There is the McClory bike path right next to it. And plenty of parking. \n\nGreat places in lake forest for coffee and a nosh after you peruse the market.",
