They carry plants for my garden that I could not find anywhere. No one else had kohlrabi.  We love it.  I always check Harms Farm in McHenry first when I am in the mood to plant!!",

I've never met more of a rude person in my life. I do not recommend anyone purchasing from this company or going to the accounting division. I would stay far and clear of this awful person and her tacky personality. \n\nFor the owner: Please learn some manners and maybe you won't have customers running for the hills.",
