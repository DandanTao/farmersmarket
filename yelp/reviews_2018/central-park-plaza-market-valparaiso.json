            "description": "The Valpo Market has grown over the last few years! As an ice cream vendor, we have been happy with the dedication and perseverance that the Valparaiso Events team has shown to grow this market. The location is perfect right in the middle of downtown and there are numerous options for crafts, fresh seasonal vegetables, food and flowers. Grab your produce and walk to one of the many downtown Valparaiso restaurants for lunch! This market just keeps better and better. We look forward to the different options every year.",

            "description": "Nice little farmers' market. With a few local farm stands, a couple snack tents/trucks, and the occasional handicraft vendor. It seems small, even for a community this size, and the selection isn't as wide as I'd like, but things are fresh local, and at a couple vendors, organic.",
