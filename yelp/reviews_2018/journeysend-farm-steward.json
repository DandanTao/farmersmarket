            "description": "Some of the nicest and most accommodating people I have ever met. We use them as a layover at least once per year, twice this year, and it is always great. Clean barn, large clean stalls, ceiling fans, auto waters in the stalls with counters, hay racks and feeders in the stalls, a place to park your trailer overnight, restroom, hot water available and the muck pile to clean out your trailer is right where you park. Super convenient and right off of the highway. They will do your nightcheck and keep you up to date. They have the most friendly Clydesdales that love to say hello. Great,  safe setting for an overnight stay with your horses.",
