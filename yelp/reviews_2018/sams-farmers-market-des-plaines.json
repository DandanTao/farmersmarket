            "description": "Shocking experience.. I found in the cooler smoked Turkey legs and wings which were molded. I informed friendly store associates which works at the meat and seafood section (even worries me more now) . I gave him one and kept on looking .. and found several more .. so I went to hom again to let him know , they better look through this .. after a while me standing their and him , he put back the molded Turkey leg and said I dont care I just leave it the I give a s... I was done and left quite and shocked about that behavior and unsafely food handling. I decided to email an complain .. not because of the food no because of that non caring behavior of the sales association.  But I didnt even received an email back. I doubt I will be back because if the store associates are acting already infront of customers like this I dont want to know what happens behind doors .. uuurrgghh",

Let\nme count the blessings: FREE COFFEE- POPCORN SAMPLES- DELICIOUS SAMPLES GALORE-PIZZA SAMPLES- SUSHI SAMPLES!!!!!! Cheap, properly cooked rigatoni ala vodka that you just reheat in the microwave at home. Ice cream,\n$1 Espresso... crazy!!!!\n(on the weekend)They've got Jorge from Caputo's, and he's gotta be the best butcher around. I think they got Angela too... the lady who\nmakes the cheese (need to verify)? They've got some gentleman manning the seafood who appears to have grown up on a fishing boat. Super fresh exotic stuff last weekend, and the guy couldn't have been nicer or more enthusiastic. This place is winning me over with every visit.",

            "description": "One of the new, smaller grocers in our area. The place seemed good. Prices for big name goods were about what other stores would charge, but there were a few deals which made the trip worth while. One thing is in-house made popcorn! Nowhere near as good as the now closed Popolicious in Des Plaines, but very good for a low price! Great for parties.\n\nThe people were fairly friendly, and other foods seemed fresh. A great place near our home.",

Two Saturday's in a row I went shopping at my normal 9:30 am time for their Barese Sausage and they had none.  Yesterday I went in to get ham lunch meat that they had advertised and they had none.  I bought their half salt pickles two weeks in a row and they were horrible. I spoke with the manager and he made some lame excuses.  Rather than make excuses learn from your customers comments and improve. I will be making the trek to Valli in Arlington Heights now. I have given this store too many chances. :(",
