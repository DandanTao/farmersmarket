            "description": "I came here today on my lunch break. I know it's brand new, but this farmers market is TINY. There were 2 meat sellers, 2 sandwich vendors, 1 cheese stand, 1 bagel stand, 1 pasta stand, and a single produce vendor. I bought a sandwich from the Trump Hotel people, and it was yummy. I hope this farmers market survives because it would be nice to avoid the insanity of Daley Plaza and have a leisurely lunch by the river, but they need more vendors. Also, it's only happening once a month. I have a hard time thinking the market will grow with that kind of (in)frequency.",
