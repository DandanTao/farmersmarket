            "description": "SERIOUSLY!!! This is supposed to be a better location?!?!? NOT!! About 30 booths. Only 2 selling produce. 3 selling meats. The rest were salad, salsa, other miscellaneous items. Access? Terrible. The only parking is in a little grassy area. And you access that area by driving over a curb & sidewalk. One plus on the parking is they striped the grass. Extremely disappointed doesn't even come close to how I feel. They said this was a better location. Nope. Not really. Much better market in the past. I'll be driving some place else for my produce.",
