They require minimum of $10 to use credit. Who is going to spend $10 on produce that is going to spoil before you can eat it? \nWith silly credit card policies, you should avoid this place and head to Thies'. Or the Dierbergs around the corner.",

You can find anything in there and assorted grains, rice, etc. I usually just look at their sign when driving by to see what is on sale, friendly staff and I think you have to spend $9 or $10 to buy with debit.",

They have the largest selection I have ever seen, and they even have custom blends for marinating and making dips and dressings. If you are looking for healthy snacks, they have containers of nuts and dried fruits. All in all it's a cool little store.",
