            "description": "This seasonal produce stand has been selling in front of the Edgewood 5 Seasons Car Wash (and other locations around town) for a number of years.  Their signs advertise Muscatine Melons, Sweet Corn, Tomatoes, etc.  They pass themselves off as local producers, but I think it's all a sham.  I'm not sure about the melons, but the corn and tomatoes certainly aren't locally grown.  I had my suspicions when I spotted the commercial produce boxes under the table that said \"Arkansas Tomatoes.\" So I asked about the origin of the tomatoes that had all the characteristics of a store bought tomato and they answered, \"Ohio\". They said the corn came from Muscatine, so I bought a bag.  I couldn't wait to have my first bite of summer with a juicy ear of Iowa sweet corn.  Only problem was it tasted exactly like the flavorless Florida corn you buy in the grocery store.   If you want commercially grown produce shipped from far away, then save yourself some time and money and get it at Wal-Mart. I'm pretty sure that's where these people get their inventory.  I felt taken and will never go back.",
