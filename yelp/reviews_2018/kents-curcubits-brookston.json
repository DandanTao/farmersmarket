            "description": "These guys raise pumpkins, squash and gourds of every shape, size and variety. It is a super-fun outing in the fall. You can get all of your fall decorative gourd action going, buy some pumpkins to carve for Halloween, and get beautiful Indian corn for the door or the buffet. Also cool little cobs of red popcorn! Some people are still old-school and cut up pumpkins to make pie our of (can you imagine?) We always scoop out the pumpkin seeds and roast and salt them. Yum!\n\nEvery Fall they have a giant corn maze that is a lot of fun to walk through. There are scary critters and other spooky surprises around some corners... It is different every year so there is always new. There is a very nominal cost to go thru the maze -- may be 2 bucks a head. Great fun with to do with kids and adults.\n\nSpeaking of kids, kids are really fascinated by all the different kinds of pumpkins and the vast quantities of them. The many gigantic pumpkins are also fun for kids to see. You can have a great time debating which is the \"perfect\" pumpkin or squash and why. You are sure to have a good time and come home with a nice bunch of pumpkins for your house.",
