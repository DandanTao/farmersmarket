            "description": "The Miller Beach Farmer's Market is great.  I only wish that it were bigger and had more vendors.  The honey stand (Panos Farm) sells the best honey I have ever tasted.  The cheese stand (Stamper Cheese) is also great and the vendor will let you sample any of the cheeses.  I am looking forward to the spring for the market to open again.  It would be great if they had a location to hold the market indoors during the winter months.",
