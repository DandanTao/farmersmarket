            "description": "Staff was very helpful and friendly and the price was right. They'll set you up with some cans to wear around your waist and buckets to dump the blueberries into when those are full. A short wagon trip out to the field(they pull you to the picking zone on a golf cart with a trailer with bench seats attached to it), and then you be a pickin! They'll even offer a bit of advice once you get out there if you're a beginner, as I was before today. We forgot to bring our take home containers, but they were happy to provide some boxes for us to use. They do specify that you bring your own to take home your bounty in, so don't expect this. I highly recommend Luedtke and will be right back there again next year!",

They even sell blueberry muffins on site (very good)  Its so nice to be out in the field picking the bigest bluest sweetest berries you ever tasted!",
