            "description": "I love the flowers, but the customer service could be better.  They offer a set of flowers that are $5 each or three for $12.  The lilies are $6 ea or three for $15.   I am at their market stand every week.  I asked if I could do two of the $5 group and one lily and give them the extra dollar to make it $13.  He said absolutely not.  I would have to pay $16.   Really?   I wasn't asking him to give me the lily for $5, I would pay the extra dollar but get the benefit of the deal when you buy three.  I think he wasn't quite listening at first and when he understood he didn't want to look like he was giving in.  Rubbed the wrong way at the farmer's market today.",
