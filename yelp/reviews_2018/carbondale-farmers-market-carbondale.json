The diversity of the food here is absolutely amazing from Scratch sodas to bread to green beans to peaches to pork to mint tea to tomatoes to Coffee to mushrooms to grass-fed beef to homemade noodles to chicken to eggs to an all gluten free bakery.  although only a couple Farmers are organic it is all local and you can talk to the person who grows it.

I like being able to choose between several folks that sell the same stuff rather than having only one or two options. There are other farmers in the area, not sure why there is not more variety. \n\nIt makes sense why they use Farmer's Market rather than Farmers' Market. It really is a market of one \"farmer\" per particular fare.",
