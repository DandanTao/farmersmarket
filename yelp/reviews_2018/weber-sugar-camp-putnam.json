            "description": "The best maple syrup I've ever had! As far as I can tell, it's only available at the Bloomington Community Farmers' Market. They give out free samples for a reason. Once you've tried it, you will be addicted and unable to eat any other syrup without longing for theirs. It's thinner and smoother than any maple syrup I've tried.",
