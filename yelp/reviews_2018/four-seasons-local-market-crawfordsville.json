            "description": "I think their website says it all: Four Seasons began as a way to \"best reach the summer market consumers through all four seasons of the year.\"  In walking in to this little store, you are surrounded by local produce such as beef from Mills Livestock, canned and baked goods from Shady Rail Bakery & Catering, lamb cuts from Silver Valley Farm, and eggs from Shannon Family Farms, just to name a few.  But it doesn't stop there: cheeses, ice cream, honey, and even alcoholic pickles can be found on the shelves.  You can tell that quality is important at Four Seasons, and though it's pricier than what you might get from Kroger, you're certainly getting what you pay for.  We walked out with some beer pickles, jalape\u00f1o bratwurst, and chorizo as a birthday gift for a foodie family member, and I'm sure we'll be back!",
