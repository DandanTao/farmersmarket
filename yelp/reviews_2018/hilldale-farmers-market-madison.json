            "description": "I ventured over to Hilldale to meet my roommate and her bf to shop at Hilldale and didn't realize there was a Farmer's Market in the parking lot across from Macy's. \n\nThere were a lot of great vendors and I didn't feel claustrophobic like I usually am at the capitol. Lots of vendors with flowers. No cheesy bread, but it's okay. \n\nI am definitely coming here from now on...",

            "description": "Sometimes I'm in the mood for the madness that is the downtown farmer's market, but usually I just want a couple tomatoes. If you just need a couple tomatoes and maybe some herbs, eggplant, lettuce, eggs, peppers, flowers but don't need 17 different kinds of pickled veggies, this is the farmer's market for you. And by the way, the egg guy will sell you just one single egg if that's all you need for the scones you're making.",
