            "description": "(in the parking lot across from Bel-Air)\nSat. 8 am - Noon; May - Sept\n\nThere were lots of fresh fruit and veggies--strawberries, blueberries, beets, lettuce, tomato plants, etc. The Pie Safe vendor was there, so I indulged in a delicious very cute heart shaped pie pop. There were lots of pies, cookies and other baked goods to choose from. There were nuts, honey, and chocolate (yum). There was some fabulous art and jewelry available, too. \n\nThere's street parking available.",

These things are better than Krispy Kremes. Also, stop by the Dynamite coffee booth (bright red trailer), for some great iced coffee, or a made-from-scratch fruit drink.",
