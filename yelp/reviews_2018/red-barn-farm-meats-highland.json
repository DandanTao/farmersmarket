            "description": "Hours are a little bit spotty and its not super cheap but the bratwursts are going to destroy anything you have ever purchased at a Wal-Mart/Target. The steaks and hamburgers are very lean and better too, but again the brats are the real deal and main reason to come here. \n\nEverything out there is frozen, which some people wont like. However they dont use preservatives, MSG, colors, artificial junk etc.  ( which is a big thank you to the processing plant in Carlyle more than those who actually grow the livestock). All the other processor of meats around Highland, ( Korte, Grantfork, the one in Albers, etc. )will add all kinds of crazy stuff (especially to pork, just read the labels if you are brave). \n\nAnyways, Im rambling now but this is a great place to find meats locally from healthy livestock you can see roaming around on the grounds. If only there was a similar place for Chicken and Turkey.",
