Yet another fantastic growing season has again blessed us with so many wonderful food gems. \nPlease enjoy pics from my last outdoor visit from this 2018 season.

The market is organized around the Capitol building/square and everyone walks in the same direction. You'll be swimming up stream and make people angry if you go the opposite way! Great people watching, fresh produce, beautiful flowers! My cousin's bridal party for married in Madison on a Saturday and picked out their bouquets that morning at the market!\n\nPro tip: if you go at or before 8am it's not nearly as crowded \n\nSomething to note: I believe they do not allow dogs/pets to be walking around the square when the market is happening \n\nFavorites: scones from the place that does almost exclusively scones (adore the espresso dark chocolate chip one!), garlic from the garlic man, honey from the guy who wears the beehive hat, cherry bomb hot sauce",

Whether you're just in town visiting or are a homegrown Sconnie, this is the place to be on Saturday mornings in the summer.\n\nThe vendors wrap all the way around the capitol and food trucks line the streets. It's really incredible supporting local businesses and seeing all of the people that come out! Not to mention, most prices are cheaper than the grocery store, and everything is natural and local so you don't need to pay extra for the organic stuff!\n\nFood isn't the only thing you can buy! but the spicy cheese bread is jaw-droppingly tasty (yes, I know droppingly is not a word). You can get everything from the most stunning bouquets to t-shirts and paintings and even a petting zoo on select weekends!\n\nI would recommend going before 9am, the earlier the better, because once 8:30 hits, it's Disney World-level packed with people. My favorite times at the farmer's market have been around 7am when all of the early birds are there raving about the mushroom haul.",

Enjoy your time on the square and get those deals on rainy days. In the fall find all different kinds of pumpkins.",

Not going to lie, I've visited a ton. It's one of the top things I seek out when traveling. I have been meaning to visit Dane County Farmers Market for years. It's the stuff farmers market dreams are made of. \n\nWhy? Well, for one thing, it's massive. \n\nTwo, the market organizers keep the emphasis on true producers and try to leave out a bunch of the carny/flea market-y stuff that can often clog up other farmers markets; \n\n3.) the incredible location surrounding all four sides of the state capitol in downtown Madison. In addition to all of the amazing farmers market vendors, you'll find local shops and eateries at every turn; \n\n4.) The prices are on-point - we arrived with a cooler, a stash of cash and a mission - we rolled out with two fresh flower bouquets (which made for a comical ride back to Indianapolis, a pack of grilling cheese from a local creamery, lots of produce and the famous spicy cheese bread; \n\n5.) There is a clear, unspoken flow for the pedestrian traffic that keeps things moving along despite the masses of humans and booths; \n\n6.) it's a longer than average market making it easier to visit - plus, it requires a couple hours to make it all the way around (if you're actually making purchases) - ohmylanta, I would spend every Saturday here if this were my town. We conveniently stayed at the Best Western on the Square, so I woke up that morning to the sights of the market from my window. This must be HEAVEN!",

The streets are blocked off surrounding the capital and you're free to circle the square as you like and check out all of the goods being sold. I believe it starts as early at 6am and people are usually all packed up and promptly headed out by 2pm. From the website, this farmer's market runs from April to early November, so take advantage while the weather is nice!\n\nThey sell just about everything from cheeses, fresh locally grown produce, cheesy breads, and even a bunch of pop up trailer/food trucks line the block for business. Great spot to bring the family and enjoy the local vibes and lounge on the grassy areas surrounding the capital building. If hanging in Madison for a weekend, this farmer's market on Saturday mornings is a must!\n\nThat's about all I got for ya on this one. 'Til next time, cheers!\n\n185/365",

You'd think with that many independent thinkers in one spot, a few people may want to go the other direction every now and then... but obviously not, there is no greater fallacy than thinking your unique.

When I finally found myself in Madison, on a Saturday with some free time before work, I knew where I was going!\n\nI am from Chicago. I've sadly never been to the Green City Market because of traffic and parking. The largest markets I have attended up to now are the Daley Center Market and the Frankfort Farmers market. \n\nThe Dane County Farmers Market is massive. All the way around the Capitol, with craft vendors spilling onto State Street and food trucks across the street from the Capitol. So much to choose from. I got squeaky cheese (because after discovering fresh, I'll never get store bought again), Stella's hot and spicy cheese bread, some croissaint and a rhubarb pie. If I lived locally or was travelling back home after, I would have purchased more fresh products. There was a lot to choose from.\n\nParking was easy, in my opinion, but I am from Chicago. Parking within a block or two of my destination is close parking, and that is what I found here.",

Despite the homogenous crowd and somewhat high prices this is still one of the better farmers' market I have been to...  but if I lived here I could not imagine doing much shopping here on a regular basis.  I guess I am used to the superb public market in Rochester NY that real people from all walks of life shop at - really more interesting and affordable.  Alas, we don't have the good selection of fresh cheese curds as in Wisconsin!",

Not only do they have tons of fresh produce at very reasonable prices they also have a ton of vendors on the various side streets.The market in Madison is just a big event all around. It also has the surreal backdrop of the Capitol building which makes for just a good feeling experience. Madison is a small town but there's so much to do and enjoy. The Farmer's Market is one of those things! If you haven't been you really should go. It's worth the drive even from Milwaukee.",

There's just something about an early morning walk around the square while browsing each vendors goods that makes me smile! \n\nI recommend getting there early, 6:30 - 6:45 AM, to beat the crowds that typically hit around 7:30 AM. The one downside, however, is that several stands do not set up until a bit later in the morning so you may miss out on those by going early. \n\nIf you aren't from Madison (or even if you are), Stella's Monkey Bread and Stella's Spicy Cheese Bread ARE A MUST. Make Stella's your first stop so you can nibble at it as you walk!\n\nMost of the parking ramps have a $5 fee upon entrance. Bring cash, as most vendors do not accept credit cards. No cash? Pop into Walgreens on the square, buy a pack of gum, get cash back = Avoid those ridiculous $5 ATM fees!",

Depending on the time of year, you can find all sorts of edible treasures.  Honey, pastries, and cheese are all season long.  You can easily eat your way around the square and still take some wonderful local produce home with you.  Several food trucks and coffee tents are on the outer corners so there are good eats there too.\n\nIt can get a bit crowded after 10:00 am, so be patient.  Bring a basket, bag, or small portable trolley caddy.  Keep a good eye on your kids and dogs, if you need to bring them with you.\n\nPlants and flowers in the spring.  Lettuce, tomatoes, beans in the summer.  Corn, cherries, squash in the fall.  Those are my usual items I pick up.",

It's fantastic to buy fresh local and in some cases organic produce! It's very affordable and I never walk away empty handed. It lines the outside of the capitol square and is full of hustle and bustle. I recommend going earlier in the morning when it first opens if you don't like crowds, it gets busier towards the later hours (10-2) and can get really bad depending on the day and the weather. \nSome of my favorite things to pick up are sweet corn, a fresh loaf of bread and some pretty sunflowers. \nQuick tip: bring a large bag to carry around with you and throw all your purchases in!",

All the wonderful farmers bring their delicious produce and share it with the small town of Madison.\n\nOver 100 farmers gather every week from April to November around the Capitol Square, bringing vegetables, fruits, meat, pastries, eggs, herbs, flowers, anything you can think of to the market! Locals, and visiting guests, come every single week. If you enjoy a slow stroll, and a good selection of produce, come before 9am! \n\nMy favorite things at the market:\nSpicy cheese bread - Stella bakery\nBlueberries from Flyte family farm\nPeaches and cherries from Door County\nGraze stand - spinach and mushroom market bun; sausage croissant; magic coffee\nBandaged cheese - Bleu Mont\nApple cider - Ela's orchard\n\nIt is just a joy to walk around the square, even if you don't need any groceries.

It's become a habit, and I like it.\n\nThe selection of items offered by the farmers at the market is wonderful: I can buy fruit, veggies, meat, smoked fish, a bouquet, soap, honey, syrup, jams, cheese and some plants for landscaping all in one fell swoop.\n\nI don't recommend going to the trouble of driving downtown, parking, buying blueberries, then leaving. Make your market trip a morning outing. Enjoy breakfast or brunch at a downtown restaurant along with your market visit.\n\nI now make it a point to take out-of-town guests to the market when they visit Madison!",

It's a huge farmers market where you are buying directly from the farmer.

Of course there are the fresh fruits and vegetables but there were also potted herbs, cheese, noodles, meats, oils, sauces, flowers etc. There were also a couple of tents selling fresh breads and cookies. I split the feta and spinach empanada from Stella's. It was pretty good. A little pricy tho. We also purchased some veggies for meals, raspberries and Macintosh apples. They tasted fresh. \n\n   The market runs along the square. I saw some reviews recommending to get there early for parking and to avoid the crowd. Maybe I was lucky but we were there around 10 and while yes there was a crowd I still felt comfortable enough to shop. It may or may not have had something to do with it being Iron Man weekend. We tried to find street parking but settled for the $5 parking in a nearby parking garage.",

It is amazing and a Saturday ritual for me since I have been back in Madison for the past 10 years.  Here are some tips for newbies:\n\n1)  Walk counter-clockwise with the other 99.8% of the people that have a clue.\n2)  Try to get there before 9 am.  After that, it becomes a cattle call.\n3)  Unless you have a gaggle of kids, leave the wagon at home.  Yes, it is kinda cute but super awkward to get around. \n4)  Gawking is ok but if you are doing so, try to keep it at a minimum.  Doing so only backs up your fellow shoppers.  And let's face it, we have all seen tomatoes, zucchini. and basil before.\n5)  Try not to smoke while walking.  Remember where you are and the people around you.  The person behind you probably has dreadlocks and walking barefoot and will mean mug the shit outta you for doing so.",

I would not recommend coming here with any of the following attributes : short-time frame, fatigue, hungover, with kids-especially little kids, strollers, dogs, or cats. People will be people and act like people in a big crowd : expect people to stop suddenly in front of you or kids cutting in and out between the sidewalk and greens around the capital. I cannot tell you how many people I hear from time to time angry at how crowded it is - deal with it or just stay home; you're really not helping and there isn't anything you can do to change probably 3000+years of human behavior in crowds. I only knock off a star because of this admitted fact - maybe the space isn't great for the amount of people but it is what it is.\n\nParking is fortunately very merciful due to all the parking garages and nearby streets. I tend to park in the same place and do the same loop for memory sakes and avoid any unforseen issues. \n\nFor myself, some of the items that stand out to me :\n\nFrozen Corn Chowder (I can't remember the stand but there is one that sells frozen corn chowder and its GREAT). I'm not sure if it's still around for 2016 but I really enjoyed it in 2015.\n\nThe Cheese Stands. If you love cheese, there is plenty to be found. Brunkow is a big one with the most variety and largest crowds due to the free samplers but there is also the notable Hooks amongst many others that might have smaller crowds.\n\nCheap as heck Spinach, vegetables. Really, the prices are much better than the grocery store - especially on spinach.\n\nThe homemade tortillas. There is a stand that sells homemade flour tortillas that I really enjoy. They have a variety of breads also. One of the few stands(maybe the only one) that sells this type of product.\n\nStellas - Everyone likes the spicy cheese bread! \n\nR&P Pasta - I like the variety of \"take home and make\" fresh pastas they sell. I believe its cheaper than if you buy it in the store. (One of the few that accepts credit card last I was there)\n\nMushrooms - Not sure on the exact stand but its smaller and sells a few mushrooms I've never seen elsewhere such as Lion's Mane mushrooms.",

Wrapped around the entire Capitol Square and spilling into the surrounding streets, this is the best farmer's market I have ever been to! Lots of amazing looking fruits and veggies, baked goods, tons of fresh flowers, artisan ingredients, handmade crafts, and more. Traffic moves in one direction, so make sure you step to the side if you are considering an item - you can't salmon-swim against the crowd to backtrack if you change your mind! Well worth getting up early for, and the Capitol building is air-conditioned if you need to duck in out of the heat as well.",

I've been to many a farmer's market, and this one, at least in summer around the Capitol Square, has the most variety, quality and great prices for local farm products I've ever seen. Some Farmer's Market have quality goods but are just too expensive. That is not the case here. The availability of eat-and-go items like Stella's give it a real European feel. While crowded it is navigable and fun to stroll through for a couple of hours. Winter it moves indoors in two different venues, with a smaller number of vendors;still a great resource if you're looking for reasonably-priced, fresh ingredients. Vendors are usually helpful and friendly, too.",

Radish, rhubarb, cheese curd.\n\nI think it was a mixture of my having been to very few farmer' markets + reading all the reviews and likening it to adult Disneyland, that made for my being disappointed in the Dane County Farmer's Market. \n\nI guess I should just be happy that it was a nice day even though the weather forecast called for rain. But with that sunshine came droves of slow walking, stroller pushing stop in the midst of a moving crown and gawk while shoving food in your mouth crowds. \n\nThe scene was lovely and the square held such potential for what businesses and goods I'd find inside, but really, I found a lot of the same ish at 85% of the tables. We did get some cheese curds from a place a Wisco lad said was the absolute best (but I'd had better when a friend brought back the dill curds from another vendor at the very same fair), but other than that, it was really just a fair for plants and people selling radishes and rhubarb. How many things can you make out of radish and rhubarb as the main ingredient? Is this a Wisco thing? Because I don't think we Illini have put much stock in the dietary nourishment of radishes and rhubarb as a main ingredient.\n\nI guess after having been to farmers market out in the SoCal area, it's probably hard to compare, but is this one really all that much superior to other farmer's markets? Maybe I went on an off day but I just wasn't as excited as I expected to be. I'll go again, but I'll have more level expectations this time, for sure.",

Madison is a beautiful city and the Capitol Square is a great backdrop for the amazing vendors and their wares.  The event is extremely organized and I like how the foot traffic flows in the same direction.  The market website is an excellent source of information and I love that I could elect to receive a newsletter each week with updates on the seasonal information and steady favorites.\n\nThe fringe vendors and food carts and flea market type tables across all four streets on the square add to the charm and vibe and value of the day.  And the breakfast and brunch dining options all within walking distance, and some with a great view of the market, are plentiful.\n\nThe vendors are wonderful people that love to tell you as much as you'd like to know about their goods.  Today I learned the best conditions for growing and foraging ramps, how allusive they can be, how they seed themselves and how short the season is.  Great lesson.   \n\nAnother important thing many vendors will share is best times to shop.   When I arrived at 8:15am the market was in full swing and the crowd was shoulder to shoulder.  I now know why the market opens at 7am - the first hour is the best hour to shop.  Veteran market goers shared that the 12:30-2pm slot usually presents a thinner crowd, but also less selection.  So pick your poison, early to rise, or claustrophobia inducing crowds.\n \nAnd  bring a big basket or bag because you'll find so many things, even some you didn't know you need.",

The flow of traffic makes sense as vendors are on the outside of the square which makes it easy to view wares and move along.  There is so much produce! As someone who loves vegetables, I had an education today. I learned about Dragon tongue beans, bitter eggplant, and a host of other unique and different veggies.  Vendors were very happy to talk about their products and it was such a positive and interactive experience.  Go hungry! There are food trucks all around and I was super disappointed that we had eaten breakfast before we ventured around.  The flowers are beyond beautiful. Gladiolas and hydrangea are blooming right now and the bouquets of beautiful colors, shapes and sizes are a feast for the eyes. Also included in the bevy of items for purchase are jams, jellies, sauces and pickled vegetables. We bought a pint of pickled beets for my salads and some raspberry habanero and blackberry raspberry jam. All are available for tasting and so pleasing to my palate! We are in Wisconsin after all, so we can't forget about the cheese!!! So many vendors sold cheese curds and other cheeses. We bought a chive horseradish havarti and a five-year-old cheddar. Cannot wait to make a grilled cheese with the five-year-old cheddar and the raspberry habanero jam!!  Finally, the baked goods look so amazing I can't even take it. My husband and I bought a bag of blueberry granola and a mini orange chocolate chip loaf for breakfast this week.  Overall, it was a great experience and I compare it to my favorite place on earth which is the Boulder farmers market in Colorado. I have to say that this one is better because it's laid out nicer, the prices are cheaper, and the vendor products are more diverse.  I would definitely come up here for a weekend again with my husband and enjoy this farmers market. Next time I'll bring a cooler so that we can bring home the pesto and try many of the meats that are sold!!  Good job, Madison. A+",

Like...7am early.\n\nFor me, it doesn't matter if I drank an entire keg the night before--you can bet that I'll happily drag my groggy, hungover ass out of bed at 6:45am so I can get to the Farmers' Market by 7. Otherwise, you get stuck in the nonstop shuffle of zombies, moving at a snails' pace. Oh, and when it's crowded, you can't talk to the farmers! Trust me, it's the best part.\n\nSo, my routine: one lap to scope out what's in season and to compare prices (yes, I am a Jew...literally). Lap two to purchase everything I want. Lap 3 for cleanup--anything I missed! It takes about an hour, but again--totally worth it.\n\nWhy is it so spectacular? Everything is locally grown and very, very fresh. The produce are phenomenal (as I nom on a tomato I bought this morning). Cheese is wonderful--especially Hook's! The meat is also great! I mean...really, can you do much better?\n\nThe farmers' market is a foodie's dream, and is definitely one of the things I'll miss when I leave Madison! Now, if I only I could convince people to stay away from the spicy cheese bread (really, it's just not very good)...",

From difficult-to-find heirloom fruit varieties to the freshest vegetables, to that family who still crack local black walnuts or hickory-nuts, to fresh baked goodies, young plants in spring, Willi Lehner's yodeling cheese stand, to that friend you haven't seen for a few years and run into at the market.  Go often, go early, avoid the crowds, the dogs, the strollers, and the slow-movers.  Note that the \"norm\" at this market is to go around the square in a counter-clockwise flow.  For those who might lack the spatial perception to figure out what that means, the capitol building will be on your left as you walk along, the streets and vendors on your right.  The market has an faq page on its website, at:  http://dcfm.org/faq/\n\nA note for animal owners:  Pets, except service animals, are not allowed on the Square during the Saturday Market per Capitol ground rules.\n\nIt is also useful to note that the market participates in the Food Share program, so for those with what is archaically called \"food stamps\" benefits, your EBT card may be accepted somehow by the vendor you want to buy from.  In 2015, Dane County Farmers' Market customers spent $49,234.00, the most federal food assistance dollars of any market in Wisconsin.

                "description": "I have heard so much about the Madison Farmer's market.  I am taking one star away because I have visited the Farmer's Market in Minneapolis, which has a little more variety and better traffic for walking.   That said, we did enjoy the market and intend to go back.  The flowers were probably one of my favorites; good pricing for some tall and bright flowers.  Aside from tons of organic veggies, fruit, honey, and meat, they had other interesting foods there.  We crossed the street to take advantage of some of the food carts selling good ethnic food.  I wish they had more carts like this, to compliment the farmer's market.  It doesn't have to be all food trucks, but a little more arts, perfumes... and other things would improve it even further.  \n\nFood trucks:  Vietnamese Tacos:  So good!   Gyro Food Truck:  shawarma gyro was so amazing.  \n\nSteinke's popcorn:  many different flavors.  It was interesting trying Peanut Butter and Jelly Popcorn.  Just for fun.  \n\nPotter's Crackers:  A little overpriced, but we bought it anyway b/c it was so good.  We bought the Rye crackers (with some other flavor blended in).  Super good and it would make a good gift for someone (hostess gift...).\n\n\nThe only disappointment I had was the Stellas Spicy Cheese Bread.  I thought it was going to be great, given all the reviews here.  We paid $9 for this, thinking it was going to be awesome.  The bread was huge, so I thought it would be something with leftovers between two people.   I was not impressed.  It tasted good, but was way overpriced.  It was a huge bread and I thought it was going to be stuffed with cheese (hence the leftover thought).  I was wrong.  It was about 90% bread, stuffed with a small amount of cheese.  If you wanted the cheese (hence the name for the bread), you have to eat (or throw away like we did) a ton of bread.  Most of the loaf bread only.  There was some cheese, but very little.  The bread tasted good, but given that it was basically a whole big bread with a tiny bit of cheese, I would say that it wasn't even close to demanding $9 per loaf.   Think about it, how much would you pay at a bread shop for a big loaf of bread?  That is what you should pay for this.  I have a feeling (and confirmed by other reviews on Stellas) that it used to be really good, they became popular, tried to cut their cost and cut the quality with it.  Totally overrated.  \n\nTips:  Parking ramp nearby on Main Street, bring CASH!!  Limited people take credit card, walk in the one direction the rest of the crowd is going.  It's a one way direction only.  If you want to walk faster, move to the left.  Slower, move to the right.  Leave the strollers/wagons at home if you can b/c it's tight during the peak hours and people will get annoyed with your wheels.   I was told no dogs, but I saws  few, barking at the others.  Leave the dog at home so you don't have to fuss over him/her.   Bring bottled water if you plan on eating as you shop the stands.",

                "description": "Going to the farmer's market on Saturday is pretty much turning into a ritual for me. It is such a fun way to start the weekend. \n\nThe produce is great, I bought some cherry tomatoes one weekend and I never want to buy them from the store again. I did not realize how good fresh tomatoes can taste. It takes a lot of restraint to not buy Stella's cheesy bread but if you have people visiting do buy your guests some! I also have seen an emu meat vendor. Can't say I've tried that yet. Herbs are great to purchase here they are usually a $1 for a handful. Great deal.\n\nParking- I usually park in one of the garages around the square, the farmer's market really only takes about an hour to do a lap so you won't be paying more than a buck or two for parking. Or you can always park a little further maybe 4 blocks away if you are willing to walk and then parking is free.\n\nWalk in the SAME direction everyone else is walking. It will make your life easier.",

At the top of State Street, there are also a number of art and craft vendors with beautiful, handmade wares for you to purchase (I was one of them for six years!) - from jewelry and glasswork to handmade soaps and clothing.\n\nThe crowds can get a bit crazy, especially during peak hours, so don't plan on trying to push a stroller or large cart through the main thoroughfare (your fellow shoppers will thank you, and your frustration level will drop exponentially.) \n\nThe market officially closes at 2pm, but don't plan on going late -- most farmers are sold out of their goods and packing up by a bit after 1pm, depending on weather and crowds.",

I love to go - choose my breakfast there and walk around the square to see the different products, and who has the best prices.  I try to buy organic foods, which is nice to get at the market, it is much less expensive than getting at the store. If there are other events downtown, free parking can be very difficult to find.  The earlier you go, the less crowded.  I didn't give 5 stars because I personally don't like large crowds.  It is becoming more and more a tourist type attraction - so being a local, when I'm there to get a couple of things and leave - it's not so easy.\nThe vendors are great and easy to talk to.  Great  variety of products on the square. I enjoy getting fresh eggs there :)",

                "description": "I feel pretty lucky that Indianapolis provides me with a large selection of farmer's markets to choose from, a significant portion of which I have been a visitor of, but nothing comes close to the awesomeness that is the Dane County Farmer's Market. That being said, if a farmer's market only had one stand that sold one item, and it happened to be Stella's selling their spicy cheese bread, I would still think it was the best farmer's market in existence. More on that later.\n\nAfter a slow start due to a member of our crew being almost entirely incapacitated by excessive drinking that was done on Friday night, we finally headed out the market. Madison is a very friendly city to those seeking to get places either by foot or by bike, and we had no trouble walking to the towering capital building sitting in the center of town. We were actually lucky enough to have picked a day to visit when they had a lot of State St. closed off for a car show. I don't know how often they do this, but it was a lot of fun to get to see on the way there. My visit was on the first weekend of June, and the weather was perfect and people were taking advantage of it. The crowd was kind of large around 11:30, but it wasn't too hard to get around in. The square of vendors lining the sidewalk around the capital building was pretty easy to navigate and see everything that they had to offer. It seems that the crowd arranges itself to have fast walkers on the outside and slow walkers next to the stands, and it worked out pretty conveniently.\n\nThere was a large selection of veggies at the time that we were there. A lot of these are the seasonal items that are in peak season, so many stands have the same options. I would recommend taking the time to walk around a little, because I noticed significantly different prices for the same items. Along with plenty of fresh foods included a plethora of bakeries, lots of butchers that sold both raw meats (including venison and emu) and cooked meats like jerky and meat sticks that you could eat while walking, all kinds of honey places, plenty of canned fruits and vegetables, and lots of plants and fresh flowers. This would be a great place to get potted veggies to transfer to a garden. There is certainly no shortage of foods to get from the local farms to satisfy your hunger on the spot, but if you want something more substantial, there are a ton of food trucks that are on the outside of the square and provide many more options. Once you get some food to eat, or if you just decide to enjoy the weather and take a break, there is an abundance of seating area in the huge grass lawn in the center of all of the vendor's tents. I'd suggest bringing a blanket, as it'd be a great place to have a picnic in the sun or under the shade of one of the many trees. \n\nThe pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, at least in my opinion, came in the form of a huge loaf of soft warm bread stuffed with melty cheese and covered with red pepper flakes served in a plastic bag that was well worth waiting the long line for. I'd been told by many people that this couldn't go unpurchased if I made it here, and I'm glad I waited in the ever-growing line as they waited on a fresh shipment from the bakery to arrive. The place was called Stella's, and while all of their other items looked good, this artery clogging medley of carbs and cheese was the item I'd suggest getting, especially if you are trying to fight off a hangover. \n\nI don't know what parking looks like around there, but I'd certainly recommend walking or biking if either of those is an option. I didn't see any ATMs set up at the market, but there was a Chase bank close to the location and we stopped there on the way to get cash. Make sure you bring a large bag, because odds are that you will leave with more than you expected to when you arrived.",

Then add a bunch of tents with awesome goods all around it, and you've got a recipe for success. \n\nWe started our trip to the Farmer's Market with a spicy cheesy bread from Stella's so that we could nibble on it as we walked around the square. That plus all the samples of cheese becomes a pretty satisfying brunch for the day. To make sure had some veggies in us, we bought some sweet snap peas to snack on as we walked. \n\nHighlights\n- Stella's hot cheesy bread: a massive sweet challah bread with red chilli pepper flakes on the top and warm soft cheese in the middle. Get them while they're hot if you can! \n- Cheese samples galore! \n- Fresh produce: lots of tomatoes, onions, lettuce, etc\n- The Herb market has shelves of various types of basil, rosemary, thyme, dill, etc\n- Fresh kettle corn made in front of your eyes\n- Small desert plants for your office (requires very little care)\n- Beautiful flower arrangements from local florists\n- A Gluten free bakery called Silly Yak Bakery (Celiac disease)\n- The cute boutique booths across from the square. Especially Spoon Rings!! (make finger rings out of antique spoons)\n- Watching people do yoga in the grass\n- Being able to go visit the inside and top of the Capitol\n\nHours\nSaturdays Jan thru Mid-April: 8am-noon\nSaturdays Mid-April thru Nov: 6am-2pm\nWednesdays Mid-April thru Nov: 8:30am-2pm\nSaturdays Nov thru Mid December: 7:30am-noon\n\nTip: Move in a counterclockwise direction to go with the flow",

Well, the folks at the info booth can't tell you (1) where to find a specific vendor - by name, nothing (2) DO NOT HAVE A MAP LAYOUT OF THE VENDORS AT THE BOOTH and looked sincerely confused when I asked. I'm laughing now but it sure wasn't funny then and (3) don't appear to be interested in creating a vendor booth map for any specific ryhme or reason. \n\nI guess I'll do it. And in crayon so it's festive =) \n\nYou have to get in even earlier nowadays to beat the crowd. It used to be at 7am - no one was there but the chefs/sous chefs & elderly elderly.\n\nNow, at 7am I'm rushing. \nIt's as if the intervals have been pushed ahead like daylight savings. \n11am - used to be stroller time but they're getting in around 9a and staying until closing. \n12noon/1p is the college crowd time, but get this..... that's the best time to go, if you want to get deals. I mean folks start to shut down but by 2pm no haggling needed. Just take it. \nHowever, if it's what you want you had better get in early. The good stuff has caught on and folks are selling out. ....\n\n5 stars for Dane County Farmer's Market for making fresh food available to middle america families that has to use WIC/US AID/Food Stamps and any other voucher program. Which is what moves my would be 3 - star A-OK. rating to a 4 star I'm a fan. Besides the offerings being redundant...it somehow works. And I'm not a \"CHOPPED\" type cook. I decide what I want to eat then get the ingredients. Now, I'll plan for a week or even longer but you can't just show up with a bunch of ingredients and be like, \"Cook. Now\" You'd honestly get soup if that occurred. And I mean from scratch roux based Gumbo to show you how real Gumbo is made.",

                "description": "The Quintessential Madison Experience\n\nI've lived in Madison for over 30 years now and I have to say that the Dane County Farmers Market in late summer / early fall is my absolute fave Madison experience.  Armed with a couple of totes, a cup of coffee and a pastry (or two) from Batch Bakehouse, my daughter and I always seem to hit the market when the crowds hit their peak and we love every minute of our slow stroll around the Capitol Square.  We talk about the past week, I share fatherly insights on how to shop for produce and we jointly plan our weekly menu on the spot as we see what's in season that week.  I can't think of a better way to bond with my daughter and kick off the weekend.\n\nWhile everyone has their personal favorite aspects of the market, here are a couple of mine:\n* Every trip to the market starts with a Farmer John's curd run.  Best curds in the land, bar none.\n* Even though I have absolutely no room in my garden for new plants, I always end up browsing through the perennials at the Flower Factory.  And I appreciate that the staff is always willing to answer any questions I have about the plague or pestilence threatening to do in my garden beds.\n* Try as I may, I am physically unable to make my journey around the square without sampling the fine cheeses from Hook's.   Anything dish I cook with cheese always tastes better when I use their products.\n* The Green Barn Farm stand located at the corner of Mifflin and Wisconsin Ave is where I start picking up my produce.  I'm partial to them since I grew up not far from where they operate and their prices are always competitive.\n\nI'm swimming against the flow here, but the Spicy Cheese bread from Stella's is vastly overrated.  Do yourself a favor, and instead of blowing $8 on an undercooked loaf of bread with a couple nuggets of melted cheese, buy some aged cheddar from Hook's or some chevre from Capri and pair it with a baguette from Batch or Madison Sourdough.   Unlike the dough blob from Stella's that hardens into an inedible brick after 30 minutes, you'll be able to enjoy this treat all afternoon.  Trust me, do this once and you'll never go back.\n\nAfter wrapping up a lap or two around the square, there are a variety of activities you can do: maybe brunch at Marigold or Graze, a bike ride around Lake Monona, a leisurely stroll down State Street or maybe a tour through the Capitol to soak in the Madison experience.  It's all good...",

                "description": "ABSOLUTELY LOVE the Madison Farmer's Market!\nYou cannot leave without trying Stella's Spicy Cheese bread. I may not be the person to ask about produce considering I typical go there to by dairy, meat, bakery products. A recent find we had this past weekend was Carmel Corn Gelato!  It is a fun place to wonder around and have breakfast. If you want to get in and get out without a lot of people it is best to go in the morning if you have kids, strollers, walkers go after 9 am when the pace is more a leisurely walk and you aren't getting in the way of the people who want to get what they need and leave. \nEnjoy!",

GOURDS GALOURD!! (get it? hehe) Summer bouquet for me? Aww shucks, you shouldn't have!\n\nI've been much, much more impressed by the array of purchasable items the last few times I have gone.

Walking with the crowd around the beautiful capitol building, enjoying it from every angle while checking out the incredible produce on display. This is North America's largest producer-only market apparently, and you can feel the pride busting from the seams and between the leaves. The baked goods are particularly awesome, with the biggest donuts I have ever seen, and an excited lineup of people waiting to get their hands on hot spicy cheese bread. It moves inside when it gets cold, so enjoy it during the summer and in the fall when it's extra gloriously gourd-filled.",

There are few like it.\n\nTake the entire Capital square, and line it with local vendors.  It's quite the experience.\n\nHere's what to expect:  Fresh produce, meats, breads, cheeses, flowers, and more all produced within a short drive of Madison.  You'll also get samples of many of those items.  \n\nYou are going to pay a lot more for stuff than what you'd pay the grocery store, but the point here is not to save money.  It's to contribute to sustainable farm-to-fork production.  You're typically getting organic, free range, well-cared for food.   You'll find many items far tastier than what you'd find at the store as well.\n\nPro tip:  Get there before 9AM or else you'll face massive crowds.  Also, leave the dogs at home, as they are not allowed.",

Every time I have been in the Madison area I made it a point to visit. Now that I live here I think I will forever be spoiled.\n\nThe market runs year round and the vendors seem to be always changing. You can find fresh flowers, fresh cheese (cheese curds!), honey, pickled goods, baked goods, and of course fresh fruits and vegetables. Slightly off of the square they have the arts and crafty booths. \n\nWe typically go early. Around 9-9:30am the crowd really starts to pick up. I'd definitely recommend getting there early; you can stop and talk to the vendors. Most of them are passionate about what they are selling. Pick up some baked goods while you're there and eat while you browse. There's ample samples, too. Everyone stops for Stella's cheesy bread, if you've never had it it might be worth the 8 bucks to see what all the hype is about. \n\nBring a decent sized bag with you to hold all of your goodies; lots of smaller bills for paying; remember to walk to clockwise, it won't be difficult to do since everyone else is doing it; do some quick research when it comes to parking, and if you opt for a meter be sure to check your watch as time goes fast. \n\nWe usually like to walk around first and see what we'd like. There's nothing wrong with comparing prices, as sometimes they do vary.",

Please place signs on the parking garages which state which is cash, card or change.  It is difficult to have a good time when you are worried about parking.  \n\nI love the theme weeks, Cows on the Square is my favorite.  When they have music stages, I tend to stay away.  It is too loud and ruins the feel of the day.  \n\nWhat do I dislike?  The strollers.  I have been clipped on my heels more time than I can count.  I get it, kids are heavy.  However, if you have to bring them, please be courteous.  Try to take a small stroller, strap them to your chest or perhaps watch out for those in front of you.  It is a very crowded walking space and strollers are hazardous.  \n\nThe market has done nothing about them and I know many people are having this issue. I tend to stay away on the more kid friendly themed weekends.  It is a shame, because the square is very unattractive while the students are in.  Now the summer is being ruined by future Badgers.  \n\nI know my review is not really about the market, but I can not enjoy it when the ambiance is terrible.",

Well, maybe large crowds, but, don't worry, it's worth it. \n\nI suggest paying to park, I find the day much more enjoyable when I don't have to walk two miles before I even get to the square. Any of the structures are cheap on Saturdays. $5 for the day. \n\nTo start your day right hold off on coffee and breakfast until you get there. There are plenty of coffee venders and breakfast pastry offerings all around the market. \n\nThere is a flow to the square. Follow the flow, especially if you have a stroller. If you have a stroller, which I always do, I actually recommend that you push on the grass alongside the crowd. I then just pop over to purchase what it is I am looking for. Me and all other shoppers are happier that way! \n\nSpeaking of kids, if you have them, look for the \"balloon guy\" on the corner of State St. I have a love hate relationship with him. I love how Happy HJ is when she gets a balloon ballerina, but I rue the day of his birth when it inevitably pops and leaves me with a screaming child. But really, you should go see him, he's good. \n\nDon't pass up the spicy hot cheese bread either. I've eaten a whole loaf in one sitting, no lie.",

Not only do they have an extensive array of local (all Wisconsin made) products, the variety is impressive.  Depending on the season they have vegetables of all varieties, baked goods, flowers, plants, herbs, pasta, jams, jellies, vinagrettes, popcorn, meats, fish, cheesecakes, and of course Cheese! \n\nIt is about .8 miles long as it surrounds the capital on all four sides.   If you are in town on a Saturday from April - November it is a must. I suggest starting early as it gets crowded later in the morning. \n\nOn colder days, take your coffee and donut up to the capital to eat and people watch.  It's free and absolutely gorgeous inside (and has bathrooms if needed).\n\nI almost forgot - you need to walk counter clockwise around the square or you will be walking against the flow.  If you need to get across the square walk up and through the capital (or around the sidewalk up there).",

I always make a quick stop at the UW Credit Union for some cash. Meet up with friends, grab coffee from a stand, share some Stella's spicy cheese bread, snatch up some one of the delicious pastries offered by local bakeries, or sample some squeaky cheese curds.\n\nThe flowers are always beautiful and inexpensive. Produce prices rival those of grocery stores, and are SO much better (especially the tomatoes). Now that fall has arrived, I can't wait to guy some of the cute little gourds.\n\nA couple tips: \n- Bring CA$H Money!\n- No dogs allowed =(\n- Go early (before 9am) to avoid the super crowds.\n- Go with a plan on what to purchase. I always get excited and purchase too much produce, and some always ends up going bad before I consume it =(",

One of, if not the best, place in the Midwest to get such a variety of fresh, local (as in all in-state), and most of all, amazing tasting produce, cheese, meat, breads, and treats.\n\nI've never been to the Farmer's Market before 7am, but I hear that's a good time to go if you can wake up that early.  We usually went around 11:30am. There is still a crowd, but we usually take our kids, and wagon, and fight our way to a spot on the grass. My husband or I will put down a picnic blanket and hang out while the kids run around and the other goes out and gets some snacks--our favorites include Stella's spicy cheese bread (apparently everyone and their mom loves Stella's, too) AND spinach empanadas, Jamie's & Son Bakery's baklava, Farmer John's cheese curds, kettle popcorn, fresh peas (pod & all raw), and berries--and food for the week.\n\nIn addition to the great food, it's always fun to just sit and watch people walk around and around, enjoy the music being played, and just soak up the sights and sounds of the beautiful city that is Madison.",

It used to be 4 for 4, but seriously, I'm totally willing to pay the extra fifty cents per bar because they are magic in my mouth. \n\n- honeycrisp apples. Usually hit up a vendor on the south side of the square. They're in season late summer/early fall. The same vendor also has delicious apple cider that always tastes a bit different because they change up their mix of apples used. \n\n- antique apples. On the north side of the square, there's a stand that has bushels of hard-to-find and not-really-grown-anymore apples. My faves have been one that tasted like strawberries and one that had white skin. \n\nBring cash, and prepare to walk slowly. Enjoy the sunshine, or the deals that come with the rain.

The Madison one has nice vendors but the experience is just unpleasant and overwhelming and annoying. Not fun. Then there's the parking! Forget it, I never go anymore. It's become stupid.

With the local food trend, I have to say that I really believe places like Madison (and other areas in the Midwest) were the original local food. Each family or group sets up shop on Saturday mornings to sell their amazing goods.\n\nI bought some fresh cheese curds from Bleu Mont (delicious) and a small plant at another stand. I also got fresh Wisconsin honey for a relative. There was so much other produce that I wanted to try, but because I was coming from out of town I didn't think I could finish it! \n\nThe spicy cheesy bread is a must. Their loaves are expensive, but they are also huge.\n\nI'm amazed that the farmer's market attracts such a large number of vendors. I spent the first half of the walk around the market totally enjoying myself. The second half started to get long, and tiny feelings of panic started to grow in me as I realized I was just being herded along by the giant crowd, haha.\n\nAs usual, there were people from so many different groups with signs or handing out literature about an issue or belief. The capitol building is a \"citadel of democracy\", and so it was refreshing to me to see people out doing their thing.",

We always buy a loaf of spicy cheese bread right when we get there and munch on it as we walk around.  We only do one loop and usually pick up a block of cheddar from Hook's, some tomatoes, a dozen eggs from Pecatonica Farms, one other vegetable that's in season, and every once in awhile some bratwursts or breakfast sausages.  \n\nThe only reason I don't give it 5 stars is the crowds.  We try to get there just before 8 and leave by 9.  I always bring a backpack plus another reusable bag for my purchases.   Bring lots of small bills if you can.  All the vendors a re pretty good about giving change, but it's challenging to have to break $20s all day.    \n\nOne of my favorite things to do Saturday mornings in Madison!",

That being said, I can't stand the place and rarely go anymore.\n\nDCFM has become a victim of its own popularity. Every year it just gets more crowded, to the point that now you feel like you're sharing it with the entire population of Madison, or at least the crunchy half. All shuffling oh-so-slowly counterclockwise around the square, stopping to gawk at the pretty vegetables, seeing friends and having spontaneous ten-minute conversations right in the middle of the flow of traffic. It's supremely frustrating, and an errand which should have taken a few minutes max turns into an hour-long ordeal.\n\nI guess it depends whether you're there for the \"experience\" or just there to buy some cheddar and get on with your day. I'm one of the latter, and I admit I'm resentful that people who are there for the entertainment value are hampering my efficiency. Particularly since a lot of them don't seem to be buying anything.\n\nI used to be a regular here, but these days I only go when there's something specific I need that I can't find anywhere else. And I arrive about 7 a.m., when the parking meters are still free and the tourists haven't arrived yet. Otherwise, I get my fresh local veggies at one of the many other excellent (smaller) farmer's markets in town.",

Make sure to take a quick walk around the outside of the market first to get a sense of where you want to stop before you walk in the middle of the giant crowd. This way you won't spend all your cash before you get to stands on the other side of the square (make sure to bring cash!). \n\nThe Wisconsin famous Stella's spicy cheese bread is a necessity for anyone who is going to the farmers market for the first time. I would also recommend buying honey from one of the many honey vendors. It'll be worth the few extra dollars compared to store bought honey. \n\nIf you are looking for a place to get away from the action for a few minutes and grab a bite to eat, Fromagination is a great specialty store to get a sandwich and something cold to drink!",

I am super invested in farmer's markets and all that they have to offer, so I was pleasantly surprised when this one turned out to be amazingly huge and delicious!  The selection was unbelievable - there was literally something of everything.  There were tons of fruit and veggie vendors as well as those who had their own homemade baked goods, foods, and other products (yarn, clothes, etc).  Amazing!  The view is also great since the market stretches around the state's capitol building.  A nice place for history buffs if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nThis was also the first time I have ever had cheese curds, too.  My friend advised me that the best and freshest curds squeak in your mouth when you chew them.  So good!  We were able to sample some before purchase and it was so yummy.  There was also coffee and breakfast stands to curb your early Saturday morning hunger.  It seriously does not get better than this.  I spent a lot of time at farmer's markets when I studied abroad in France and this definitely rivals some of the best European farmer's markets.  It is large and very traditional.  The prices can't be beat, either.  A lot of farmer's markets here in Chicago sell amazing goods but the prices are rather high - the Madison Farmer's Market has its prices just right.",

The market goes all the way around the Capital square.  My husband and I like to go around 7 or 8am to avoid the crowds.  Around 10-10:30am it starts to get really crowded and by noon it's just packed.  The walking traffic all goes the same direction, so follow the crowd if you are a first-timer.  If you need a break from the crowd, there is plenty of green space and benches to sit down for a while while you snack on delicious scones, pastries, cheese bread, cheese curds, and whatever else you can find.   My husband and I like to pick up something simple to eat for breakfast while we are shopping, and there is always something different and delicious to try.  \n\nThe selection of food here is amazing!  Tons of different meats (including grass fed beef), cheeses, fruits, veggies, flowers, plants, honey, maple syrup, homemade breads/tortillas/baked goods, etc.  There are tons of organic options as well that are much cheaper than I have found in the grocery store.\n\nTip:  The parking structure is only $3 when the market is going on...plus it keeps your car out of the sun.  My husband and I always throw a cooler full of ice packs in our trunk, so we can store our farmers market purchases while we wander around and grab lunch somewhere.  There are tons of things to do in the area...check out the view of the lake from the Monona Terrace, go up to the observatory in the Capital, or wander through the shops on State Street.",

Mmm. And nobody's toes get damaged in the process.\n\nSeriously, who cannot like farmer's market? It can get very crowded, so I suggest you go early or late to beat the \"rush hour\" of the market. But geesh, lately it's been busy the entire time, that doesn't stop me. Fresh produce, local goods, and cheap prices. Make sure to bring a bag to stuff all your goodies or you'll wish you did.  A backpack works best. If you're looking to buy something that you don't want to haul around the last 3 blocks (say a beautiful flower basket!), many of the vendors are more than happy to hold it for you and you can drive up on your way out (just don't forget where you bought the it, that would suck).\n\nI'd say a full trip around the square can come to around to 1 hour or 1 1/2 hour.

Even if you buy nothing, it's worth the experience.

I couldn't resist the unique trinkets  and bought a few pairs of local-made earrings and a necklace for my mom. I had no problem feeding the post-run munchies with the variety I found here.

Right now, Madison has a lot of construction, but even so, parking was not too difficult for a bunch of out-of-towners to find. (And compared to Chicago prices, was DIRT cheap.)\n\n Lots of cheese, produce and honey/maple syrup.  (I was disappointed in my search for onion relish...guess it isn't a Wisconsin thing...ah well....) \n\nSaw at least 4 kinds of mushrooms (sadly, no morels), herbs (dried, fresh cut and for planting) and lots of flowers and plants for sale. All in all, the most fun I've had at a farmers' market, and I LIKE farmers' markets! (Maybe it was the scent of the maple-glazed bacon flavored long john...)\n\nI was really pleased about the maple syrup cause I bought two gallons to brew into  this year's summer batch of vegan ackermel (like mead, but with maple ONLY, no honey). Got a decent price and the Krause Family folks were good enough to put it aside till I walked around the fair. \n\nNow,  be aware, the market is on the sidewalk around the capitol building and as such, during a hot summer day with lots of crowds, one gets stuck doing the shambling zombie walk. Be sure to stay hydrated and take a break or two from the press of the masses.... \n\nThe art booths were an unexpected pleasure. Got a lot of Yule shopping done way early!\n\nIt was fun to hear the assorted street musicians, read the protest signs and look the petitions over. \n\nAnd to top it all off, there was a drive by from the Naked Bike Riders.

This is the only place I have ever found where I can get a 20 year aged cheddar. (Which was delicious by the way.) It is an excellent way to contribute to the local economy and to struggling local farmers. The station will identify itself as organic if it is and make it quite easy to navigate and find things. Yes, of course there are crowds, but that is a wonderful thing! Look how many people care about local farming! There are many street performers as well, and I always appreciate their entertainment.",

Since I haven't put in my two cents about one of the most awesome things about Madison summer and fall, I decided its time to review the farmers market.\n\nVery near and dear to my heart, the farmers market (specifically on Saturdays) is not only a place to see and be seen by friends and the entire community, it is also the perfect way to start out your day. Yes local farmers sell fruits and vegetables, but you can get so much more beyond that:\n\nCHEESE, cheese spreads, cheese curds, local honey, maple syrup, pastries, bread, coffee, plants, cut flowers, popcorn, fish, game, sausage, eggs, beeswax candles, specialty garlic, goat cheese and ice cream, jam, springtime flower bulbs, pumpkins and gourds, hot peppers, homespun yarn, Amish-made fruit pies, and the list continues...\n\nSet surrounding the state capitol building with street musicians performing, and local kids groups doing random shows, and political booths at every corner, so much happens in the community during this weekly gathering. After you've done the loop, turn off down onto State Street for a walk and continue to experience why Madison is such a unique and wonderful city.",

Highlights from the most recent visit:\n\nCheese artisans--bought myself an expensive little chunk of Wash Bear goat muenster and peeled delicious little slivers all week. \n\nSpicy cheese bread--husband walked up, told the lady, \"I've never had one before--pick me out a good one.\" She hefted a couple, found one with a nice tail of cheese visible on the outside and handed it over with the admonishment that he must start eating it immediately, while it was hot. I hadn't had bread in ages, much less hot, oily, cheesy bread. It was worth the splurge.\n\nA kohlrabi as big as my head.\n\nA choir of very plainly dressed people singing sternly about how we're all going to die pretty soon and must make good with our makers--I decided it was the worst spot for a vendor to have, a real buzzkill, but one of the easiest for a shopper to make it easily to the counter. \n\nPolitical rallying, mostly for the side I favor.\n\nBeautiful mums at a good price.\n\nFarm-fresh eggs. Glad I got them in our first pass, because they were gone by our second walk-around.\n\nGorgeous organic golden beets, the most beautiful green onions I've ever bought, and the biggest cauliflower ever.\n\nThe view. At the feet of the capitol building (which also means convenient restrooms), with glimpses of lake. \n\nEasy, reasonably parking in nearby garages.",

They won't make it easy for you.\n\nThe market moves indoors in November and loses about half of its vendors.\n\nBring cash. Don't worry, this is also the cheapest farmer's market you'll ever go to. 5 tomatoes for $1. A bunch of arugula for 50 cents. Pie pumpkin for $1. The stands are constantly changing.

Considering myself an adept \"city walker,\" at first I wanted to dash in and out of the slowly moving mob of people as they walked in a counter-clockwise stream around the capital.\n\nAnd then I learned to just embrace the slow-moving, slack-jawed quality of the whole thing.  There seems to be a certain etiquette in the stream.  Everyone just seems to agree on a nice easy pace, where it's possible to see all of the products: the beautiful flowers, the dried emu jerky, the fresher than hell cheese curds, and that damn spicy, hot cheese bread.  \n\nThis is really the only must have item for me at the market.  It comes in a steamy plastic bag, having the heft of a sock full of quarters  This shit is substantial and could easily fill four hungry bellies.  Laced with red pepper flakes and cheese, I rip through these loaves with something akin to reckless abandon.  \n\nAnd if you need a break, shuffle on down to the Frank Lloyd Wright center.  Take that meandering walk to the top deck overlooking Lake Monona.\n\nAnd only when you're ready, perhaps having steadied your hand with a sup of bourbon, head back towards the capital.  Queue back into that slow line of human cattle, as soothsayers and democrats try to foist universal health care propaganda on you.  And as apple-cheeked Wisconsin dames hand you that steaming bread filled bag of goodness.  Don't scoff at the seven dollar price tag.  Just tear a hunk off and shove it down your gaping maw.  And shut the hell up.  You're in Wisconsin.",

Maybe I'm biased because for part of my life I grew up in Madison, but I've been to so many markets from Milwaukee, to Chicago, to San Francisco, to Frankfurt, to Strausburg, etc and I always keep coming back to this one for more.  \n\nOf all the things that are truly great about the city of Madison, the Farmer's Market takes the cake.  Going down there on a Saturday during the summer (anytime between say 6am-2pm) and your delighted to a throng of denziens looking to get their fresh food fix.  You'll run across literally just about any food you can think of from cheese, to mexican, to ostrich meat, to healthy greens.  And just about every stand's food is to die for.  \n\nThe atmosphere couldn't be better.  The Market covers the entire Capital Square, and some of the other activities going on spill into nearby areas like State St.  You can go shop for trinkets, or you can wet your palette with some wine and a tasty cracker spread.  Or if you're not hungry, then simply walk around and enjoy the sunshine and happy-go-lucky feel of a large body of satisfied people.  The Memorial Union isn't too far either, so taking a break to watch the ducks, walk along the water, or hear a band isn't out of the question.\n\nThe only drawbacks to the Farmers Market are the parking and the crowds.  Sometimes there is just TOO many people there, and it can get a little overwhelming.  I've had times where myself and others had to go take a breather because there was too much bustling.  And if you try to find a street spot, good luck.  I'd suggest a ramp, and even those are full sometimes.  If you come either really early in the morning or really late in the afternoon you're probably ok, but the best time is at its peak (8am-10am).\n\nAbsolute Madison Classic.",

But seriously, this farmer's market is pretty awesome.

The farmer's market goes around the entire capital building, and there are countless stands full of fresh fruit and vegetables, baked goods, sausage and cheese.  Of course, there were always the most crowds around the cheese stands.  And why not - we had a bag of cheese curds, but the best thing ever was fried garlic cheese.  It was like eating garlic bread without the bread - soooo good.  \n\nAfter a while though, you basically see the same fruits and veggies, just being sold by different vendors.  I will say this, get there early, because when we got there around 11:30 or so, the good selection of baked goods was already declining.  \n\nI was tempted to eat everything - the giant 1 foot donuts in particular looked delicious.  Also, I absolutely love people watching there, and it's fun to buy a couple things to eat and sit on the grass and watch all the people walk by.\n\nI almost forgot - this place was also memorable for when I accidentally slightly nudged this older gentleman and quickly apologized.

My friends and I would usually meet up and wander the square a few times, comparing prices on produce and picking up food for the week. $25 worth of food could feed me like a queen until next Saturday's market. \n\nI especially loved the market culture. All of the vendors are extremely knowledgeable and passionate about their wares, and are just friendly people in general. I once had a long conversation about heirloom tomatoes with a particularly talkative vendor, and another time spent an hour conversing with Jim the Jam Man about his refurbished Victorian home. \n\nThe farmer's market is also very \"Madison\"  - war protesters, Democratic Party recruiters, Amish vendors, GLBT advocates, and country hicks all happily co-exist there. Visiting the market made me appreciate Midwestern/rural culture for probably the first time in my life. Definitely make it a point to visit if you are ever in the Madison area.",

There were places to buy coffee, sweets, and a Thai vendor, but not much else to make a lunch out of. We were out of town visiting, so didn't have as much need for the beautiful selection of farm goods, venison, grassfed beef, etc. etc.\n\nAlso, the crowd is extremely dense and you get the impression you are in a cattle drive.

The one in the town I live in pales quite sadly in comparison.  It seems like there aren't a ton of resellers of stuff that can just be gotten at a wholesaler with a \"local\" label slapped on, which is a good thing (we have a ton of that going on).  Nice balance of fresh meats, cheeses and eggs to go along with the veggies and fruits.  For about $20, I wound up with a full carrier bag, which was a nice surprise - our markets in Chicago have really jacked up prices for almost everything.  I also had one of the best iced coffees I've had in a long time from a cart on the edge of the market so yay for that.  Quite excellent - I will be glad to brave the traffic and the people for this one!",

Get your cured meat fix at the D&G tent, where incredible beef jerky abounds.

On Miracle Grow!\n\nCircling the State's Capital building are hundreds of merchants and thousands of customers (20,000 / day on average). This IS the place to be (especially considering Madison has only 200,000 population). \n\nSince there are so many merchants and even more consumers, more than just the corn, cabbage and apples are available ... and at prices that rival neighborhood grocers. \n\nMust haves at the Farmer's Market include cheese, flowers, herbs, cactus, pie, honey and meat. Cheese curds usually run about $4/lb, but come in a variety of flavors including Cajun and Garlic Dill; splurgers can feast on some of the world's best cheese (PBS actually made a documentary on the world-class cheese-makers featured at the Madison Farmer's Market. Also, of special note are the delicious pies offered by the Amish ... grab some vanilla bean and warm up a slice of their pie in the microwave ... and you'll be in your comfort food bliss zone. Meat vendors offer farm-raised cattle steaks at value; once a steak is cut into and savored, it will be near-impossible to return to Copps and attempt to eat one of their steaks. \n\nThe cons of the farmer's market are: \n\n* Lack of parking - finding a parking spot downtown is near impossible on the 1st pass ... persistence and comfortable shoes pay off.\n\n* Must have change - the metered parking is hungry and provides only 1.25 hours. After every rotation (usually takes one hour or so), it is best to chuck more change in the meter (and also gives you an opportunity to put goods in the trunk). \n\n* Saturation - The crowd is saturated with people seeking deals, baby carriages, wagon pullers and etc. If you hate walking shoulder to shoulder in a crowd, it is advised you seek one of the other dozen or so Madison area farmer's markets on Saturday.",

We NEED something like this in Chicago.\n\nBeing a gal from the big, bad city of Chicago, I was unaware of how many local farms are located in the Madison area.  Well, lemme tell you, I sure found out on Saturday morning at the Farmers Market.  I was blown away at how much fabulous, fresh, locally grown and organic produce, meats, cheeses, ciders, baked goods and well, pretty much anything else you can imagine, are right at your fingertips in Madison.\n\nI would advise getting there as early as possible.  Folks definitely have their favorite farms and some of the popular produce can be picked over.  But you KNOW that I woke up at the crack of dawn to get down to the market, so I pretty much had my pick of the litter.\n\nI came away with a veritable bounty of great stuff that is not only good for you because it's as fresh as possible and mostly grown without any chemicals, but its cheap!\n* An overflowing pint of raspberries that I may or may not have already finished.\n* Huge, gorgeous leeks\n* Multicolored bell peppers.  Purple peppers?  Why not!\n* The biggest, freshest bunch of dill I've seen.  What can I make with dill???\n* Organic honeycrisp apples that will be quite excellent this week for lunch that were sold by the hottest farmer ever.\n* A full pound of locally grown green beans.  Crisp.  Delicious.\n* Head of fuzzy garlic.  I'm told it's a bit sweeter than regular garlic.  We shall see!\n\nMy head was spinning with excitement at the awesomeness of this Farmers Market.  Its such a treat to have access to such wonderful, healthy food.  I can't wait to go back!!",

A majority of items here are sold at a pretty reasonable price (almost a steal is some cases). Knowing this, it actually makes me wince a little now when people say it is too expensive to eat healthy. Most seasonal items I found to be cheaper than Trader Joe's...which was a nice surprise for a college student living on a tight budget! Don't get me wrong, however, some of the items you may find your self paying a bit more for...namely the exotic cheese/cheese spreads, some of the more lavish baked goods, and a few nonseasonal items. However, if you can't really find them any where else and love them, they are every bit worth the price :) \n\nUnfortunately, I am a major pansy when it comes to cold weather and take to hibernating pretty early on in the year. I blame my Mediterranean roots! So, I never quite made it to the indoor market my 4.5 years at Madison, however, I deeply regret this fact and hope others don't make the mistake! \n\nSo, if you are living in Madison, TAKE ADVANTAGE of this market it is hard finding one this good (and this affordable) outside of Madison, AND, if you are just visiting Madison, check it out! However, please don't blame me if it makes you want to leave your busy city life and move here ;)",

The vendors are friendly and helpful, and you can find almost anything you need to make wonderful meals and snacks. Five stars for that. The only reason I'm knocking off a star has nothing to do with the food or the vendors, as much as it does with the speed of foot traffic. Without fail, I always find myself stuck behind a morbidly obese couple tearing off pieces of spicy cheese bread and stuffing it into their mouths, completely oblivious to those stuck behind them that are more interested in checking out what other vendors have, rather than watching this kind of couple eat from their shared feedbag. The other problem are parents with strollers who do roughly about the same speed as the obese couples. Folks, you have to be aware that there are others at the farmers market that perhaps would like to move a little quicker. I know it gets tight at certain spots at certain times and that's completely understandable.  It's when there's a good 25-50 ft. of space in front of tweedle-dee and tweedle-dum that I think to myself that they're hardly moving fast enough to burn the calories from a bite of cheese bread.",

Great produce, great baked goods; the only problem is that it's SO popular that you can barely move and goods have gotten overpriced. You can often buy the same leafy greens and fruit at Willy's for about 20% cheaper. Still, a great spectacle and a wholesome Saturday morning activity.",

It circled the Capitol, so we just picked a spot and started around till we ran out of cash! We didn't get much fruit or veggies because we were traveling, otherwise we would have gotten some beautiful strawberries.  There was produce,  of course, but also tons of great booths of cool stuff like arts and crafts, (even got a marble sample from a wierd guy selling marbles...), honey, canned goods, cheese, meats, and baked goods. I was out of money, but we had fun tasting pestos at the  pesto and pasta stand.\nWe didn't stay for a super long time, but we got some ten-year old cheddar(after trying lots of samples) some cheese danishes, corn salsa, rosemary infused salt, chicken bratwurst and some other fun samples. We shared a cup of green chili from the New Mexico stand, and my sister got some guac and chips. Parking was pretty easy, and after walking around we were able to stash our stuff and head on to brunch on State Street. Great weather-good times. Lots of really cool live music too...",

(especially since our farmers markets don't open for a few more weeks!).  its crowded, and you have to shuffle around the market in a slow line of hungry local food enthusiasts, but its wonderful there are so many great farmers and producers to support. (i also think that madisonians have a way more affordable farmers market scene than in chicago)  \n\nour favorites : the blue cheese from Hooks (blue paradise, its sooo creamy)\nthe bison steaks from Cherokee Bison farm\nand any of the vendors for crisp fresh greens and asparagus. \nof course lets not forget the classic spicy cheese bread (which was low on both the spice and cheese this time, but still fresh out of the oven..so i wont really complain) . i didnt see anyone selling eggs or fresh milk, which really would have been amaazing, but maybe later on in the season?",

I have been to several markets in various states but this is by far the largest with the greatest variety of vendors.  I live in Austin, TX where you have a better selection at the grocery store than at the market which barely occupies one block.  The Madison market surrounds the entire capital with venders packed tightly together.  I like to go early and pick up some beef sticks to munch on while scoping out possible veggies to steam for dinner.  I love cheese and what better place to buy cheese than the proclaimed cheese capital of the world?  It does get very crowded by late morning and things sell out.  So get there early.",

But even better is the fascinating sociological experience of viewing the spectacle of an endless river of people circling the square counter-clockwise like muslims circling the Kaaba. Why do they do it? Is it for the same reason they seem unable to take down their Recall Walker posters and accept the results of a free democracy? Plus at each corner and entrance to Capitol Square one finds assorted loonies pitching their brand of spiritual and political snake oil. I have to say it is not the best farmers market I have been to: Burlington VT's puts it to shame IMHO with a much more diverse group of cheese, charcuterie, meat/poultry, and dairy products on offer, plus great globe-spanning prepared foods. And Burlington's scene is just as loony left as Madison if that is your political flavor, but there is a tolerance and respect for different opinions and freedom that seems missing in Madison.",

What I loved about the market was that you could really tell what was in season: strawberries, rhubarb, sweet snap peas, and radishes. This is what most vendors were selling at very reasonable prices. I picked up a bag of fresh snap peas to snack on as I walked, or \"shuffled\" around - it is very crowded and not designed well enough to have people going in both directions, or even one direction for that matter! Nonetheless, I sampled a few cheeses and cheese curds, looked at all the very popular bread products and even the rarer treats: ostrich and bison jerky, and I finally purchased an amazing rhubarb turnover. This treat was worth the five stars by itself! The rhubarb had jut the right amount of tartness and I think the filling was mixed with a little bit of cream which cut the tartness nicely. The pastry was moist and sweet. I enjoyed my treat on the beautiful grass hill in front of the Capitol Building and got to people watch - another of my favorite pastimes. Overall, a very pleasant local Mad City excursion and when the breeze kicked in, I dare say it was a heavenly experience!",

                "description": "Best Farmer's Market EVER!!! In college, I think I hit this up every Saturday from late May until early fall (when pre-gaming for Badger games took priority).  Even when I go now, I have the same ritual...get up early, be to Michelangelo's Coffee shop around 7ish, enjoy a cup of coffee and either stroll solo or with my mom or friends around Capitol Square.  First time around to enjoy breakfast and scope out the best deals...usually a raspberry danish, pumpkin bar, or cranberry muffin, and the second time to make my purchases.  Each season offers wonderful fruits, veggies, and flowers....in the spring, I'd always stock up on herbs for the garden, and most times, I'd leave with fresh mushrooms, spinach/lettuce, and fresh cut flowers to decorate the pad until next Saturday.  And tomato, berry, and apple season cannot be beat!  What a great place to visit...the best days are game days when the UW band provides tunes to browse by.  Such a great vibe...and don't forget to check out the art vendors near State Street, too...pretty cool stuff from jewelry to paintings to pottery.",

The abundant produce, meats, honey sticks, fresh flowers, fresh pastas, trout ladies, cheese bread, cheese spread, CHEESE CURDS! are all awesome. This morning ritual of mine is something I miss more for the sense of productive community. This is because I've been coming here ever since I was 3 years old in my red wagon. We would see neighbors, made relationships with local vendors, attended market school for kids (you do things like plant your own strawberry, or learn about compost), my mom's friend even dated Farmer John for a while... There is truly something for everyone. One of my favorite things about the market though, is that it doesn't close in the winter. It is moved the Madison Senior Center, and though the pickings are much slimmer, you can get a six dollar market breakfast every sunday morning. It's done by volunteers that sometimes include Madison celebrity chefs like Chef Tory, using market products. The result is a healthy, delicious meal set to whatever live music group is playing, on an otherwise uninviting WI winter morning.",

                "description": "i am completely in love with the madison farmer's market.  i've now been to a fair amount of farmer's markets around the country, but going to the madison farmer's market was a religion to me.  saturday mornings i would dutifully rise early in the morning, make the trek down to the capitol square, and embark on my favorite weekly journey.  if you enter from state street, here are some directional tips, cuz you sort of have to learn where the deals are.  immediately to your right they sell the best basil vinagrette around that i'm thinking of enlisting friends to ship me from madison since i crave it frequently. there are a couple places that sell minibread, but bypass the first one and wait till you get to the second one.  DEFINITELY get the chocolate chip banana bread.  try their other kinds too, but that's still my favorite.  get fresh cheesecurds and try the baked cheese samples on the skillet of the large cheese tent.  buy some tomato basil bread from the first bakery or the spicy cheese bread from the last.  all around the square are beautiful flowers, fresh, reasonable, and diverse produce.  you can even buy ostrich meat from the ostrich farmer, and after being adventurous i've gotta say it was pretty delicious!\n\ni could go on with specific examples but it's not just about the actual products.  it's the smells, the feel, the crowd.  it's beautiful around the square, the aura is crisp and friendly despite the crowds - i'd even go so far as to say it's a spiritual experience.  no other farmer's market i've been to can touch it, so if you're lucky enough to be in the area, it's definitely worth the early alarm!",

Plethora of options from scones and breads to vegetables to apples to emu (yes, emu) meat.  All the vendors were very helpful and knowledgable about their products.  Also none of the loud yelling and pointing found in other farmers' markets (a la Haymarket)--must be that Midwestern charm.",

If you're at all interested in food, set your alarm clock early and come here--you'll get at least one good idea and the ingredients with which to carry it out. And remember--walk counterclockwise!",
