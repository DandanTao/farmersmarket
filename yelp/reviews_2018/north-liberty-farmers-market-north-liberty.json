            "description": "I love that this market is held on Sundays (11am-2pm). It's so perfect for those of us who don't always make it to the early markets on Sunday, and it's a nice way to spend the afternoon. \n\nThe offerings vary week to week, but there is usually live music and a mobile food vendor, in addition to traditional farmer's market offerings. \n\nThis smaller market definitely has some growing to do, but as North Liberty continues to expand I'm excited for its potential!",
