            "description": "Here is a review you won't read everyday.  The Potosi Livestock Market is a cattle auction that is held every Saturday at 1:00PM.  It is a medium size facility but has a rather small sales each week. (100 to 300 head)  It's convenient because it is held on Saturdays so the hobby farmers like myself can attend without having to take off work.\n\nI will give you a little explanation if you haven't been to a cattle sale before.  The place has seating like a small theater that surrounds the ring.  The cattle enter from the right side and they hold them in the pin for a 30 seconds to a minute and they exit the left side.  As any auction, you raise your hand, nod your head, raise a finger, whatever you need to do to confirm the next bid.  After the cattle sales they will normally sell a few pigs and goats\n\nThey also have special Horse sales and Small Animal sales where you can buy chickens, ducks, geese, goats, sheep and about any other thing you can imagine that is small.  These special sales typically start at 4 or 5pm on that Saturday.",
