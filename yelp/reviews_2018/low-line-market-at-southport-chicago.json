            "description": "I'm very committed to my relationship with my CSA but after walking halfway to a dinner where I was responsible for bringing tomatoes without the tomatoes I needed a quick pit stop. The market is small, tiny compared to Green City Market in Lincoln Park or even the Daley Plaza Market but has a good variety of vendors. Multiple farm stands, a stall selling canned goods, a butcher, and fresh made pasta. \n\nI grabbed perfect cherry tomatoes from a stall I didn't get the name of (eeek) and on a whim also got half a load of garlic bread from pHlour bakery and cafe. The bread was prize worth. If you're lucky enough to get off at Southport get your produce here!",
