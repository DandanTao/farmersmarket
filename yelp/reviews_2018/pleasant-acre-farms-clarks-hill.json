            "description": "This season our family bought a half share in Pleasant Acre's CSA.  Our kids are just toddlers now, but I imagine we'll graduate to a full share in another couple years.  \n\nWe'd been sampling the fresh produce from PA at the Lafayette area Farmer's Markets all last summer, and really liked what we tried.  Especially the lettuces.  Who knew lettuce could have such amazing flavor?\n\nAnyhow, the CSA investment has been well worth it for us: kale, broccoli, potatoes, beets (including the vibrant greens), radishes, and early this summer -- shell peas.  This was a revelation to me, as I quickly discovered that fresh peas eclipse frozen just as frozen destroys canned.  It should have been obvious, I know, but somehow I never sought out fresh peas the same way I did corn or beans or even sugar snaps.  Foolish me, I know better now!\n\nGive these guys a whirl when you see their booth at the Farmer's Market.  It's a small family operation, totally local, totally sustainable.  I don't think they're certifed Organic, but they do grow everything as naturally as possible.  Plus it's all so fresh & yummy!",
