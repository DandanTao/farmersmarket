            "description": "The farmer's market is on the property of Nature's Touch.  Some of the same vendors you see in Beloit and Janesville markets are here too, not all, but some.  It isn't as busy as Beloit, not as many vendors, but being smaller allows to talk more to the vendors and learn about their products.\n\nWe discovered a knife and tool sharpening service and the time we went we took a bunch of tools for sharpening.  Very good job!  The popcorn vendor has a unique blend of salt and sugar, which is tasty.  There is a man who creates yard items and I purchased a potting table from him.  A gorgeous piece.  Great craftsman.\n\nThey had plants, some vegetables, but we have been told by the organizer as summer continues, additional vendors will be bringing more produce.\n\nBonus, we get to walk through the nursery and see what's new!",
