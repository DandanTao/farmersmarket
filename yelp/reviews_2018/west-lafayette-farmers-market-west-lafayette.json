            "description": "Nice variety of local goods and wares. Slight increase in street traffic on market days but police assist in traffic control and pedestrian crossing. Many of the vendors participate in the other local farmer's markets. A great way to get groceries for the second half of the week. Get up-to-the-minute updates from their Twitter account http://twitter.com/#!/wlfarmersmkt. Sign up at the booth to get your free West Lafayette Farmers Market reusable grocery bag (on  your 3rd visit). Buy local!",
