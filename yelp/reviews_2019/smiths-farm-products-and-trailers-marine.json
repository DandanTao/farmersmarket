There's a scale to weigh your produce, and a box to drop your cash. Currently, there's pumpkin and squash, with a few  tomatoes before the frost. If you're looking for a deal based on price, then you probably won't find it. But the quality is usually there.",

I've never seen the Smiths, but their stand is always stocked with fresh produce in the summer, and pumpkins and mums in the fall. They have a scale and everything is self-serve, which is nice that they trust their customers. I've gotten the best tomatoes of my life from this stand and wish I could visit more often!",
