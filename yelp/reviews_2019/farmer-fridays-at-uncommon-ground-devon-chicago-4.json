            "description": "This is an organic farmers market. There is only one farm represented, Harvest Moon from Wisconsin, and that is all you need. The owners, Jennifer & Bob Borchardt, are always on hand to describe what it is they have this week. They are incredibly nice people who have great tips for different ways to prepare their yummy produce. I have discovered new fruits & veggies every week. The heirloom tomotoes I picked up this week are indescribably delicious. The large red onions got chuckles because with no chemicals they grow such immense produce! Jennifer says it is their soil & I have seen the produce to believe it. I can't say enough about this place. I love it & don't miss it unless i am out of town. I have the Lincoln Square farmers market on Tuesdays in my neighborhood but that only has one organic guy & he has about 4 products. This one runs the gammut: from eggs & cheese to basil and melons. I can't say enough good things about this one!",
