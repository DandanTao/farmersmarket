            "description": "Farmstand in Springfield with high quality locally grown produce. Selection in early September was tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, zucchini, squash, apples.  Everything looked very good and the woman working there is quite friendly. I went here hoping to pick apples, but they don't offer pick your own. They do have many available for purchase in half peck bags though and they really are good for being home-grown. I saw on another website you could pick apples here so that was a bummer, but I guess they do have pick your own strawberries in the spring. Worth stopping if you are in the area.",
