            "description": "Peoria's Farmers' Market on the Riverfront operates every Saturday during the summer. A diverse collection of farmers and crafters fill up the parking lot across the street from the Contemporary Art Center on Water Street. On 6/22/13 Keith & Abbie Folken provided entertainment, and on the 29th the Air Force Band of the Midwest played. The lady from Aleece's Chips had a table showcasing power bars and other baked goods. The Bicycle Surgeon was operating on a ten-speed. One vendor was selling 3 sizes of bows that shot foam-tipped arrows. Panaderia Ortiz featured their Mexican pastries. Sean Pollock features honey. He said he'll be harvesting 7/6/13 and won't be there, but he will return the following Saturday. I'll get back to you with more business names.",
