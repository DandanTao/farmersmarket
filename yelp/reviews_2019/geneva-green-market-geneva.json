            "description": "It's the best market I've been to in the Tri-City area.  The vendors are from sustainable sources.  There's amazing produce.  There's a cheese guy.  There's a local meat guy.  There's great bread.  What more can you ask for??  If you love quality ingredients, go here every Thursday when in season (June-October).  Also, friendly people run the market.  (It's located on the west side of the river, just north of rt. 38)",
