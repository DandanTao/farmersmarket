            "description": "An amazing Saturday farmer's market that covers two levels inside the Emmanuel Lutheran Church in Evanston.  A lot of the farmers are from the summer farmers market - for example the Nichol's Farm Orchard, mushroom people, sprouts and micro greens and, of course, Katic's with their delicious breads and croissants.  It was wonderful to be able to get fresh vegetables and potatoes there, in addition to freshly prepared breakfast and lunch entrees Their muffins, sandwiches and soups were delicious.",
