            "description": "I don't usually review things on Yelp, but I was so appalled by my experience at this produce stand in Wilmette and their being so disrespectful that I had to write something.\n\nI went to buy some produce from Chicago Organics and they were awful.  Not only did I notice that they lied about a lot of their produce being local (when it wasn't), but they seemed like they were just more 'get-rich-quick' types, trying to make an extra buck off of the green movement.  They didn't seem to care about me as a customer and the owners are terrible for lying to honest, hard-working people about their produce.  The produce wasn't even good for being so ridiculously expensive.  I would never give them another cent of my money.",
