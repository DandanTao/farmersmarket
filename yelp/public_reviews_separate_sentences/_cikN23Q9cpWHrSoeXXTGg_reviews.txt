Worth going out of your way a few miles.
Apple Maps directions told me to park along I-74 and walk: I believe that that's illegal and anyway there's a fence...
Tried samples of most of the cheeses they make and bought a few: nice double-cream, aged Gouda-style, Parmesan-style, plain cheddar curds -- those being my favorites.
Not especially cheap, not wildly expensive, raw-milk.Up and coming farmstead creamery.
Small business so you will be greeted by the cheese maker, Fons Smits.
He will slice what you would like to try and share details about the origins and ingredients of the cheeses.
Extremely friendly and with a solid business plan this creamery will make its mark!
For those in the know, he worked for Cowgirl Creamery in Northern CA and created their Red Hawk and Mt.
Tam varieties.Super!
I love it.
The Jakes Wheel and Kickapoo are delicious, absolutely delicious.
I can't wait to try other flavors!Good cheese!
We caught up with them at the Batavia indoor market at Gaetano's, looking for some of the Vermillion River Blue.
We sampled the blue, the Kickapoo, and the double cream, and all were pretty tasty.
The Kickapoo reminded me of a parmesan, and would do great as something to grate over pasta or maybe add to a risotto.
The blue has got a very nice balance, not too sharp.
The double cream was also nice and rich.
