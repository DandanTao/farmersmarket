Mostly, the fresh mozzarella balls will do.
I love the fact that they offer cheese with a twist and each cheese tastes truly unique to anything else I have ever had.
Okay so the cheese is from Wisconsin but that's close enough to be local in my eyes. mmmm smoked string cheese, fenugreek goat cheese and an amazing wisconsin cheddar all smuggled back to California.
Ask for a free taste, and I guarantee you'll become a fan!!!
The tomato and basil curds were squeaky wonderful straight from the bag.
I randomly sampled some apricot brie and the combination of flavors was delicious.
I've never tasted anything like it.
It is the sweetest most flavorful rendition, I've had the good luck to taste in Chicago and maybe anywhere.Forget your high- falutin' Caprese salad, just turn loose with a chunk of this Swiss, a fresh tomato and a salt shaker-- too good to pass up!Chipotle cheddar, pepper interlaced into the cheese actually looks like art. with a good bite but not a lot of heat, smoky aftertaste that, at first, put me off a bit, but hey it's chipotle.
I pick up my cheese at the Glenwood Sunday Market in Rogers Park, and what a tasty treat.My most recent purchase was the marscapone/garlic/herb cheese blend - a spreadable, tasty delight.
