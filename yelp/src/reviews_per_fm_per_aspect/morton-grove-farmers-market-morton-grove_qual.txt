My parents love getting fresh produce from the Farmers' Market, especially apples and potatoes.
Great service, quick, yummy tacos, yummy tamales, and especially yummy elotes!
There was a woman nearby with home deÃÅcor - honestly it reminded me of things that someone's Great Aunt Ethel would have all over her home - not my taste, but it might be a good gift for someone's Great Aunt.
There was a gluten-free product table, but they appeared to be pretty cleared out by the time I got over there.
Pretty awesome on a cracker or by itself!
Since I grow some of my own greens at home, I talked to the guy about his growing methods to share ideas.A well-known name in drinkable yogurt, Lifeway Kefir has a booth too.
I expected the cherries to be sweeter and the madelines to taste light, fluffy, and fresh vs. tasting like they had been made 2 days ago.I will be back though.
Was expecting it to be bigger, it wasn't, which is good for me.
What most people don't know about farmer's market produce is that it is truly organic but most small farms can't afford to pay for the inspection and label that goes along with organic.
