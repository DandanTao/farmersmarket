Very friendly staff, like that they hire local youth to work there.
This place was great.
They were super super nice and they offered to let us sample anything we wanted.
Fruit was decently priced.
We were pleasantly surprised not only was the asparagus a great price but they had several other deals which could not be beat.
They also carried some local products- greek yogurt from a nearby dairy, sausagesand processed meats from atleast two different processors- Wennemann's(St Libory) and Wessel's (Mascoutah).
