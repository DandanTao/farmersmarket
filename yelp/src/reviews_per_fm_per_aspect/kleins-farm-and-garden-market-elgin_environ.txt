The prices are a bit high, but not for an independent farmer, just versus Meijer or Home Depot.
I would never support a business like this and you shouldn't either!
The staff at Klein's are extremely helpful and kind.
Family-owned, and the staff are helpful and friendly.
It's one of those one-of-a kind places that makes the neighborhood special.
Support local businesses!
Wonderful family-owned business.
The owner helped us pick out a wonderful blend of perennials and annuals for the flower bed because we were quite lost.
Such a wonderful place.
This is a charming little rustic market near the corner of a busy intersection.
