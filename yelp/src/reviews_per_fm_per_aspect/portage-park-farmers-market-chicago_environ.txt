I enjoy Farmers Markets that accentuate the local communities culture and businesses.
Find local vendors, veterinary shops, dental offices, and other local businesses.
You will get a few of the larger farmers market vendors, but I appreciate the character of this market.Portage Park for the win.
And listen to music!
These are small, local farms and they grow seasonally.
And have fun doing it!
We buy various products from this guy, which are always amazing. patzmapleandhoney.comI also appreciate that they have regular dog adoption events.
In a neighborhood where you do not always see a lot of the locals out socializing together, it was nice seeing so many people come out for this market.
There is obviously community interest in it, we just need the people in the area to continue supporting it so that more produce vendors will buy in!
Lots of local support, local businesses, and best of all, IT IS LOCAL!
Very friendly and knowledgeable vendors with a great selection.
There is always live music and it is the perfect setting to lay a blanket down with your family or dog, eat some delicious crepes and drink coffee.
Portage Park Farmers Market you get another star!Ten mini pumpkins and gourds for $2.00...be still my Autumn decorating heart.Huge bag of the freshest spinach I ever bought for $2.00...recipes scrolled through the brain as I paid!Sign the petition for Portage Park to get an enclosed Doggie-Park, please!Still small.
Still plenty of parking.
The live music is a nice touch, too.
Have heard some excellent music here too.
Bring your dog with you and take a break in the nearby dog park.
Now, if only more local folks would get involved so that the market can continue to grow and flourish.
I waited 2 weeks for this and it only had 1 farm participating.......and not much to offer, and not the best prices.....There were booths with nut, coffee, t-shirt, cheese, meat, bread, hot dogs, olives etc.....everything seemed overpriced and overhyped.
