A very reasonable price of 5 dollars gives you three generous bags of different flavors and shapes of treats your fur baby will love!Next stop was Toasty Cheese food truck.
The owner chatted with us and told us they may not do the food truck event again next month in Schaumburg due to the low turnout from the town of Schaumburg charging customers 5 dollars per person to just enter the event.
We attend the Long Grove events for 5 dollars per person so it wouldn't be a problem for us to pay however it hits hard to the food truck business with lack of customers.
They dont allow dogs which is mind blowing since it is an outside market for crying out loud.
We have a small dog about 7 pounds and we carry him in a doggie carrier most of the times.
As far as produce goes..the place looks good when you first get there but its actually quite small.
This is a farmers market, not a dog park.
There are also customers here who maybe don't like dogs or are allergic.
For those taking off stars because the prices are too expensive, these are the prices you will pay across Lake County.
It's a fairly small market and it's lacking in produce stands.
Some of the vegetables looked sad and wilted already and I couldn't believe the prices they were still charging for them.
I'm giving this 2 stars because apparently dogs aren't allowed into the market.Half the reason I go to farmer's markets is because it's a place where my dog and I can socialize with other pet owners.
I went yesterday (7/14/2013) and there was only one vendor selling vegetables, which I may add were over priced and wilted.
If you've been exposed to coastal farmers markets you're going to see a huge difference between the quality, selection and price versus what our local little midwestern market offers.
