I was pretty psyched to see this place, so I drove in and found some amazing produce sold by really nice people!Most of the stuff they sell is locally grown, and what isn't local is clearly labeled.
These folks tell you exactly where you are getting your produce from, so if that's important to you, they've got you covered.Their carrots here are amazing.
Let me tell you, the real carrots that you have to peel and cut are 100x tastier than baby carrots, and the carrots here are the best I've ever seen (or tasted).
I also picked up some beautiful arugula (just barely bitter and delicious), celery, 6 ears of corn, and a few other items.
For the quality I would have honestly paid more, but I got out for less than $25 for over a week's worth of produce.
All the produce looked really fantastic and fresh.
Lots of fresh veggies.
Very disappointing produce and even worse customer service.
Produce left MUCH to be desired being dry and bitter when expected to be luscious and vibrant.
I bought a half-dozen ears of bi-color corn for $2.50 I believe (they were pre-bundled and I prefer to choose my own from open stock, but the one I pulled out and had a look at looked good, and all the tassels were still golden and sticky, a sign of fresh ears).
White corn and bi-color sweet corn.
It's very large and healthy!
Took a ride out to the "country" to get tomatoes and fixin's so hubby could can a batch of his delicious chili sauce.
The corn is picked fresh every day and all the produce is fresh and good.
And they sell a sauerkraut that is the best ever as well as great pickles.
