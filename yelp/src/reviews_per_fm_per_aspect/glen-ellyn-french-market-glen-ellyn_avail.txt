It's expected to continue until the end of October.On our visit here, there were a couple farms selling produce, several bakeries, stands selling granola, tea, iced coffee, sausage and cheeses.
Not a lot of vendors compared to Wheaton and even little Warrenville, but there is a decent choice of "farmers", meat purveyors, bakers, and random sellers of jewelry and olive oil.That said, the biggest negative is the lack of shoppers.
