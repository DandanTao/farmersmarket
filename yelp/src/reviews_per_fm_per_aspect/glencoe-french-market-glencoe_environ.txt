It's a small town, but I'm constantly impressed by my surroundings.
I am not writing this review about the people who are selling here and I hope the best for them and hope that people support them.
There are plenty of other great markets in this area, although I think it's kind of remarkable that absolutely tiny towns like Ravinia (which is not really a town as much a sub-section of Highland Park) and Lake Bluff offer farmers markets that are absolutely remarkable in what they offer.
The fact that this Farmers Market - which used to be great - has been allowed to dwindle down to a couple of stands - is another example and it's really unfortunate.
If anything, Glencoe should take a look at what Lake Bluff is doing, managing to turn a downtown area that was not much of anything not that long ago into a cute destination that has, little-by-little, offered more in the way of great restaurants/cafes and little shops.
Small but definitely functional.
