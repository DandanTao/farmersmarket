The baked goods are plentiful and delicious.
The other things of the farmers market, like Lesters Bison and Nana's Rum Cakes and Wildflower Bakery and the wine tastings they have really help to balance out all of those nutritious fruits and vegetables-makes it worth it.
We also tried the bison patties already formed and they were really great.
We weren't sure what to expect but I kid you not, very flavorful and juicy.
If this was regular ground beef and it was that thin, it would have been dull, tasteless and dry- the difference was very surprising.
And I love supporting local business, but the spectacular taste of these rum cakes is what keeps you going back.
I like the plain-vanilla or the plain-vanilla with nuts, but my husband is a drag and doesn't like the nuts, hehe, so I sacrifice for him. ha ha While the chocolate rum cake was okay, we both agreed it was not as special.
It takes a great effort to keep a high quality market going year after year.
