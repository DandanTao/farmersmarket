Oh and we get farm fresh eggs, pork chops, grass fed beef and for a lot less than the grocery store.
Sweet corn too, holy cow, I think it was $3 for 5?
I asked two farmers if they have anything organic or free of chemicals and one basically laughed at me while he said no and the other one rudely said "You wont find ANY organic food around here."
Come on arlington heights, you have idle free zones and brag about trying to better the environment and yet you dont have any organic or chemical free produce at your dinky farmers market?!
