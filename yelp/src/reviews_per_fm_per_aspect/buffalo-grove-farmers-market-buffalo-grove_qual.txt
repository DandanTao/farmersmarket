You may come across vendors who's produce doesn't look great or they charge too much.
The best thing about this market was the fresh squeezed lemonade I bought.
We decided it would be best to do a lap to see what looked best and who had the best prices, and we ended up mixing/matching veggies from various locations (I will admit, the tomatoes looked better at some locations than others) and because my main squeeze came with me, I had more cash and more hands to buy more things!We bought sweet corn, bell peppers and garlic from Geneva Lakes - 13 ears of sweet corn for $5.00 (or 50c a piece.
We have less quality for twice the price.
