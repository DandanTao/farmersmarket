There is intentionality in having an even variety of vendors selling local, sustainable, good food.
Lots of fresh fruits and veggies.
I love the variety, but think we could still expand a little bit more.
They offer a good variety of produce and plenty of parking is always a plus.
We normally purchase produce but they have a lot to choose from!
YUM)Calzaffles (calzone waffles - what!)A garden club frequents once a month and gives out clippings I really enjoy the Brookfield Farmer's Market.Nice variety of fruits and vegetables from local farms and farms from MI.
You also have a variety of baked goods, deserts, sauces, and my favorite...toffee from Kory's Kandies...OMG it's so good.
Buy a cup of freshly brewed coffee and peruse the vendor's offerings at the market.Only thing missing this year is a vendor for meats and cheeses.
That's fantastic too...not too pricey and low key :) Pretty small but great selection of local items!
I love the selection.
I chose Nicaraguan, as I have a thing for Central American coffee.
Most weeks, as long as everyone shows up, all of the basic staples are covered (fruit, vegetables, breads, eggs, cheese, and meat) plus lots of extras and this year, consistently good entertainment.
The best vegetables, fruits, baked goods, eggs, dog treats, flowers, etc.
It is smaller but I think it's a great selection and I have never been disappointed!
