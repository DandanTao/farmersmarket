While the chicken was being processed, the shopkeeper brought me into the back to see the live chickens, ducks, rabbits, and even a turkey, wandering the livestock area, apparently searching for an escape.The processing area was extremely clean and I have no qualms about becoming a regular of this establishment.I'll have to admit, I felt sad for the fate of the bird I purchased, but that's the way I want to feel.
The only downside was the cleanliness of the shop, it looked really rundown and kind unsanitary but then again you are running a mini chicken slaughter house in the city.
Clean and very fresh!!
Friendly service and as clean as a poultry shop in the city can be.
I would definitely bring my chickens here again.Regarding some other reviews of the cleanliness of the back room, all I can say is that I went back to see my chickens butchered and I don't think anything was unusual.
It is a small indoor farm, so it won't look like a lab; but for what it is, it is very well maintained and pretty clean if you can factor in normal animal life.
The prep area is very clean.
Owner is friendly and we chatted for a bit while chicken is slaughtered and cleaned.Muslim owner, muslim butcher I asked if the chicken were zabiha.
They'll slaughter, clean, dress, and pack it for you quickly, at a remarkably low price.
The equipment looked clean, and it's as humane as such a process can be.Oh, and someone commented about them being packed into cages--yes, most are.
They then pick a live chicken for you to approve and proceed to clean and butcher the meat to your specifications.
