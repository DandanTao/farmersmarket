Some of my favorites I've seen at other FM in the area, like Lester's Bison Farm (good quality meat, lean and inexpensive comparatively), Mama's Jams, and Wild Flour Bakery.
Yup, that's the name and it sounds funny to me, too- and not necessarily associated with something too pleasant- but they make quite a big and delicious spicy pork tamale.
It was pork with green sauce (the filling) and not what I'd call spicy at all, but it had great flavor, proportions, and texture- very moist!
