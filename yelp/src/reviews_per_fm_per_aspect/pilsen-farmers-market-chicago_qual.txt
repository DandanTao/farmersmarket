The botanic gardens have a great stand with the most delicious sweet chard and kale that money can buy, for 2/3 of the price that you pay at whole foods.
I picked up some delicious honey made by a beekeeper that lives down the block.
Soy Organic market is there with delicious teas and local bakers present an assortment of cookies, cakes and breads.
Michigan is cheaper, but, call me biased, but the IL one has some better produce.
Once fall hits, I'm only doing organic tomatoes, as those are the closest ones to IL's awesome ones.
The blueberries from Michigan are a better deal.Sometimes, people who sell vegan baked goods come.
The mushroom people have good salsa (but it doesn't taste "Mexican"). The Indiana tent had some cheap cilantro, but their cherries were from Washington (WTF?).Other places come to sell their wares, jewelry and whatnot, but I always come for the produce.
Grow big!
Just a two minute walk and I am greeted with several produce stands as well as a few other food vendors.I know this is a growing market - if you know vendors, get them to sign up and sell here!
I love that the produce is all fresh and in season items.
