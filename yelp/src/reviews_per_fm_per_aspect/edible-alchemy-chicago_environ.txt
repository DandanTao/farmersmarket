As an added bonus, if you volunteer you'll be exposed to awesome music, lovely people, and Andrea or Dietrich usually bust out some crazy exotic fruit for you to sample.
It's an amazing model and I have really appreciated it.The fact that it is a true old style coop with volunteers, and no hard and fast established store front in the traditional sense keeps the prices exceptionally reasonable.
