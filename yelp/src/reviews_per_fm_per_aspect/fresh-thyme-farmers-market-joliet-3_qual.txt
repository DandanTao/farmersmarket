They have everything you need produce, vegan items, fish, meats, and a big section of vitamins, supplements and all things healthy.
Store is always very clean and employees are friendly as well, some stuff is a bit pricey but you pay for quality Outstanding selection of organic produce - and they have great produce sales!
Fresh Thyme, not so much.
The bananas were very fresh looking though.
They have more organic and healthier options.
The prices are a bit higher, but the food seems to be better quality.
It's never horribly crowded when I go, the produce is usually pretty fresh, and I'm a fan of the bulk section.
It tastes like it is squeezed with the utmost care and attention.
You must try their fresh made sausages.
They have amazing salads, prepared foods and their bulk foods section is amazing.
Fresh and delicious.
I don't eat red meat but the fish was very good.The salad bar isn't much to write home about but you can grind your own nut butter or fresh oats--soooo good!
There is a lot of organic, non-GMO and plant based food, fresh and frozen.
OH, and delicious fair trade coffee.
Highlights are the fresh sushi (and very friendly sushi maker,) the hard-to-find organic swiss water decaf coffee, fresh squeezed orange juice (best thing ever), and their organic milk selection.
The produce selection is very good and the quality of it is high.
Their egg and milk alternative options are slightly higher than most in the area but they make up for it with their produce and meat deals that seem to be ongoing every week!
Fresh out-of-the-oven pizza and sushi make for an awesome dinner to-go.
This was my first visit to a Fresh Thyme store.
