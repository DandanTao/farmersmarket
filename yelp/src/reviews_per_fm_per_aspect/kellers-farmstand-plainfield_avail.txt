There were also plenty of bags available to put my corn into.
They also had fresh tomatoes, squash (yellow and Zucchini), string beans, large melons and other fresh vegetables and fruit.
They also had a large assortment of jams, local honey and canned vegetable available along with olive oils and other condiments.
I buy my flower and vegetable plants here every spring.
They have a big variety, and it's so easy to shop in their greenhouse.
They carry tables and tables of vine ripe tomatoes of many varieties.
They have a vast variety of canned items such as pumpkin butters and salsas and the like.
Baskets of green beans, bell peppers, jalapenos, squash and zucchinis and more.
I purchased 8 green peppers, 3 cucumbers and 2 red onions and it was right around $11.
