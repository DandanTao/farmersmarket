We took a hay rack ride out to the pumpkin fields and found a great variety of pumpkins and gourds.
We bought three good sizes pumpkins and a few small plus a few gourds for just $10.
We also had hot apple cider, kettle corn and some of the best apple cider donuts (still warm!).
Good selection of produce and baked goods.
Great little orchard with petting zoo and farm fresh vegetables and food.
Bus loads of kids, pumpkins, gourds, corn, apples - very nice!
The inside of the main building also is full of canned goods - preserves, pickled items, BBQ, and sauces.
