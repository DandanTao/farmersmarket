The strawberries are delicious and it's easier for the kids to pick there than at other places where you have to pick off the vines.
The family is very nice.
Their boys are friendly and hard working - shows my sons what they are missing out on!
One other family is there.
I fully expect they are more responsible than the vast majority of commercial farmers selling to supermarkets.The staff was nice and quite helpful.
The staff was friendly, not too crowded.
For 2 small buckets of apples (about 25 apples) I was charged $34.00.
People this crooked and rude should not be allowed to remain in business!
