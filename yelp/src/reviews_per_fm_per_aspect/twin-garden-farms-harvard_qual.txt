If they made corn flavored candy it would not be as good as this.
And this corn is crazy good.
Corn is exceptional in flavor, but sweet corn I have had in a long time.
Prices seemed a bit higher than I'm used to seeing on some of the produce at local farmer's markets, but most of it looked fresh enough to be worth it.
These companies produce corn seeds in the lab then plant them and sell the final "product" to us as fresh and amazing corn!
My senses grew confused and I found myself buying some of the bicolor corn.
