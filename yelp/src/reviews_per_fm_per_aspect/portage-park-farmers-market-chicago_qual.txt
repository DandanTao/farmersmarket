There were perhaps 18 booths still going, some of which has just started to close for the day.There were merchants selling produce, meat, dairy, pastries, and more.
We ended up buying some fresh produce from farms.
The one thing I wish we'd gotten fresh eggs.
What it lacks in size it makes up for it with the quality.
It is so nice to stroll through a beautiful park on a Sunday and munch on delicious, local products and take home local produce.
Even in late July the majority of the sellers weren't there with produce, but with prepared goods.
There was only one tent set up with actual produce and while the prices were pretty cheap, I felt like the produce wasn't very fresh.
A lot of it looked really dried out and not the best quality, especially compared to other markets in the city, which was disappointing.
Hopefully it was just a bad week for them, I will check them out again next time to see if the quality looks better.
This market is in a beautiful setting and the vendors a great mix of food and goods and the list of both has and continues to grow.
