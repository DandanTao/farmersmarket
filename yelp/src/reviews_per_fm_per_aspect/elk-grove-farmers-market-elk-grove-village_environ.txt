The vendors are very nice (some take only cash, some take credit as well).
Everything is fairly priced.
They also have a DJ playing music in the background - nice touch!
I loved it and I can't wait to go back. come and support your local farmers and local organizations --- and eat fresh fruits and vegetables --- different vendors each week, the group that made it are the ones who woke up early and were responsible enough to set up...the ones not present, are the ones who partied a little too much on Friday night!
Tons of fun activities for children and families and everyone is very friendly.
