Some offer samples; some don't even post prices.
But Skokie's is convenient, has easy parking and, such friendly vendors.
Yeah it is pretty small but prices are reasonable, it's right outside my back door practically, and ur supporting local businesses.
Small market & NOT ONE organic vendor.
Market is smaller than most in the area, but you can find pretty much everything you need.
The prices are a little high but comparable to what you would see at other markets.
There is one larger veggie stand that has pretty good deals compared to the others, not sure the name of it but it is one of the first tents if you enter from oakton.
Kids are allowed but no dogs.
My dog is my kid.
Such a sad place Great small farmers market and one of the few open on Sunday.
There were some young men playing stringed instruments, it was a gorgeous morning and everyone we met was very friendly.
If the parking lot is full, you can park in bank lot right next door.
Prices here are decent, but you arent going to find any exotic produce here.
I like the cheese booth but they tend to be irritating by not labeling anything or putting out prices.
If you have any dull knifes that need to be sharpened Tony does a great job at a fairly good price.
The only reason why this market lost a star is the parking situation.
The parking lot is very small and it is hard to find places.
