Also, watch out for the BEES, especially around the berries and other fruits.
They've been so bad before that we've gone rushing out of there.Other than that, I'd say check this cute, little place out!
Likewise, some small red onions which looked cute had rot towards the middle of a number of them.
How great is this place?
Family owned and well maintained.
Parking is tight, but the turnover is quick.
Despite how big the establishment looks on the outside, it's not as big as you would think since the inside of the barn is about 80% registers and employee work space.
This place was a "you serve yourself" type of place.
Overall, cute place, brings fresh produce locally at a more permanent farmer's market type of philosophy.
Parking has a quick turnover.
Some things ROCK, some things don't, and some things are A-OK.
The staff is always friendly and no matter how crowded it is, they get you out of there fast!I hate to see the season end and have to go back to buying grocery store produce.
The prices are really good!
There was no staff out front that I saw but there were 4 cashiers inside that were nice - appeared to be young (maybe High School or College age).
