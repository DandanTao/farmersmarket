The quality of their produce was quite surprising... some of the best I have seen in a long time.
We tried many items... veggies, fruits, bakery, beef, coconut shrimp, etc... all exceeded my expectations, for quality and freshness.The coconut shrimp, we're among the best we have ever had, period.
I was on the hunt for bagels and found a package of Asiago cheese that looked really good, no expiration date though.
So into the cart they went then I looked for either vegetable or jalapenÌƒo cream cheese to go with the aforementioned bagels.
Good quality produce options, and a large organic section.
They're carrying the right stuff for a certain demographic and I'm sure people who prefer cheap food and good deals may not appreciate the quality over bargain.
I bought a Fresh Thyme bottle of water with whole lemon chunks in it.
I will miss their sushi and pre-made salads, they were delicious.
I had a homemade pizza today from Fresh Thyme.
