I grow many things but my garden space isn't big enough to grow all of the things I want.
Their produce is minimally treated and picked fresh and ripe every day.
I am making vegetable soup tonight and every vegetable was still growing as of this morning!
I buy all my vegetables here, and take a big bag to work to make salad at lunch.
I can't even count the number of times people will comment on how delicious it smells--salad! --because everything is fresh and at its peak.
But when produce is this fresh, you crave it.
These actually taste like strawberries!!!!
And delicious as well!
