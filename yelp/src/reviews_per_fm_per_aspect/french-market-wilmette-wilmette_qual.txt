Lots of bakeries, crafters, fresh cut flowers, and produce.
Prices are not cheaper then the grocery store, but the freshness and quality are better.
I'm the kind of person who shys away from spicy things, but I found his hot sauce to be delicious and addicting!
It would be nicer if there are more organic vegetables featured, but in all it's an interesting place to visit.
There are also delicious, condiments, sauces, and other products available.
The food is much fresher and even less expensive than the store.
The fresh made crepes are delicious, too!
Where oh where are the organic produce in this area?
If you want organic produce well- I don't know where to tell you to go in this area but This is not the place.
