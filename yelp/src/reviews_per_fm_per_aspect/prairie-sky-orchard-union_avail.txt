Great apples and pumpkins.
Also try their apple cider and a slice of apple pie.
There's a little store with other fresh goodies that you can take home with you.
We picked a little of everything that was available (Golden Delicious, Fuji, Gala and Jonathan).
Just apple picking, varieties to choose from, plenty of great looking and tasting apples.
They have a nice store with various pies, butter, jam and salsa.
They don't have a huge variety of apples to pick but it's not busy and it's clean.
They have several different varieties.
In the barn, they have cider, doughnuts, pies, jams, and other items.
It was gorgeous, and there were still plenty of apples left, although my husband is freakishly tall so we were able to reach up for the good apples all those average size people left behind.
