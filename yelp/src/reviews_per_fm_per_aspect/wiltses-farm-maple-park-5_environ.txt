Great family owns this place.
Super friendly and kind.
He's so friendly!
Friendly, very affordable, many wonderful, seasonal options.
Service was friendly and the place was well organized, with a wide selection of produce.
I was able to get about 12 ears of corn for decent price as well.
Sure, I get a little gassy, but it's worth it, and I blame it on the dog.
When I'm out that way, I love to swing by and get some fresh veggies - its a great family farm.
He couldn't give me a date to pick them up, a set price, and could not set aside a quantity for me.
There are a lot of great farm stands in the area, but this isn't one of them.
The original owner was one of the nicest, friendliest people you could ever meet, the vegetables were fresh and great quality, and the prices were fair.
Now, I still can't fault the produce or the prices, but the friendly, nice atmosphere is gone.
Yesterday,I was left to carry a massive pumpkin to my car without help, when there were many employees standing around.
People were extra friendly and willing to help out!
