We ended up picking 26 pounds of colorful and delicious produce and made apple pies as well as crisps and tarts.
I understand that we had a tough winter, but all they had was Golden Delicious and Jonathan and you are forced to pick 3 pounds of apples per person.
Well, if you like Golden Delicious, you're in luck.
Do you like Golden Delicious?
Have I mentioned Golden Delicious yet?!?!
The country store is the only redeeming quality, unfortunately the people that work there are so grouchy!
Rather the store was redeeming because the cider donuts are awesome.
Choose from Macintosh, Red Delicious, Golden Delicious, Fuji and a few more.
