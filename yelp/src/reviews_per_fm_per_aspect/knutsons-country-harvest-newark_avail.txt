You have to PHONE FIRST or check Knuston's FB page for berry, apple and peach availability.
Strawberries are available thru early Sept.
Also only got to pick apples once but IL has had poor Spring weather these past years and apple harvests have suffered.This is a very small family farm, not a huge corporate enterprise.
They do not spray so peaches and pears are full of bugs There are not enough to even pick.
The blueberries, cucumber, peas, and green beans looked very good.
Maybe it was because we arrived on a Sunday, but when we inquired about peaches, we were directed to the tables where there were 3 small containers of peaches - that was it!
After looking for a u-pick farm somewhere close to the Chicago area to pick peaches, the website for this farm seemed perfect- highlighting that they offer u-pick rain/shine for fruit/herbs, a variety of vegetables, and different types of berries, pears and peaches.
They both have stores with lots of item to be purchased and gorgeous apples as well!
