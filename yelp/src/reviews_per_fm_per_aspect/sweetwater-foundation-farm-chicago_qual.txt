SWF is all about regenerative social justice, and does awesome work teaching aquaponics, urban agriculture, and the like to inner-city students.Anyhoo, I was looking for organic greens for a client, and a friend directed me here.
Upon arriving, I saw the plethora of veggies growing, but couldn't locate a soul!
