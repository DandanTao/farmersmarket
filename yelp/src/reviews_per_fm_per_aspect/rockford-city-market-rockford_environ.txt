We even were able to take our son over to the permanent cooling off fountain the city has where he and the other kids can play in it while the parents watched.
Parking is a little difficult.
There is a lot of public parking, but it was full by the time we arrived and ended up having to park in the public lot over by the Metro Center.
If you go, bring cash.
Some places might take cards or checks, but it seemed mostly to be a cash only arrangement.
However, food and beer are abundant, as well as live music.
Great local artists selling their items as well.
Plenty of parking near by.
Had a great time, very good to take a family to.
Thats the only good thing i have to say about it.The crowd at the city market seems to not realize that their are other people there besides them.
To even think about getting a sample of something or asking any questions about the products of a booth, you would literally have to push through the 8-12 people who decide to over run the tent so they can continue to snack.
I've seen too many people stand around the same tent for hours to keep getting samples. buy a damn jar or bucket or what the f*** ever and get out of the way so other people can enjoy these booths too.If it weren't for the crowd of disrespectful rockfordians, i'm sure it'd be a great place to visit.
When the event banned dogs, it became even more of a downer.
The vendors are great individually and I still love going to the market for the fun products and delightful foods, but it's not as great as some of the markets in Beloit, Madison, and Chicago.
As it becomes more popular, which is seems to be, it needs to grow in space and in vendors.
