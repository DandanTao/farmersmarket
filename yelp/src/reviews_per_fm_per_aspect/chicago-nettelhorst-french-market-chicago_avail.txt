The number of vendors is disappointing as well as the variety of offerings.
This has gone on ever since I have been in Chicago, small but nicely "curated" with a well picked collection of desserts, vegetables, and other specialty items.
This market is small and limited for Lakeview.There only one flower vendor, no more than four vendors selling veggies, four vendors selling baked goods and couple vendors selling jewelry.The prices are a little higher than the other markets, however, the market is good if you need some fresh veggies or fruit if you don't have time to go to the Lincoln Park market on Armitage.The aisle are narrow so not a good place to bring pets or strollers.
Ciabatta, great pretzel rolls, etc.
They usually have 3 or 4 produce vendors... one specializes more in fruit, another has Mirai corn and other stuff, another has a little bit of everything. if you've never had mirai corn, go here and check it out!
Great baked goods, several farm stands, fresh flowers, and a changing assortment of other booths.
I should be going here for the fresh fruits and vegetables -- you won't see strawberries like these at the supermarket! -- but it's really the pretzel bread and cheese loaf that get me out of bed on a Saturday morning.
You can find seasonal produce (we're in strawberry & rhubarb time right now), as well as a selection of staples (potatoes, onions, lettuces), and usually some specialty items.
Several stands sell their own jams and jellies, and a bee-keeper has been offering honey there lately, too.
There are frequently stands with specialty food items, like barbecue sauce, olives, or cheeses.
This year, there's a yummy olive oil vendor and some jams and jellies.
All of the fresh breads, herbs, oils, veggies and fruits blend together to make some of the best smells in the city.
Great farmer's market with a unique selection of vendors.
Last year they had Brussel Sprouts the size of your fist that were the best I've ever had!
