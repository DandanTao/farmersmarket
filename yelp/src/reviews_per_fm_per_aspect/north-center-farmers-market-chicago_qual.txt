A few too many strollers for my taste, but it's worth dodging them to get to the produce...and cheese...and bread.
Only a handful of booths, all overpriced (only one worth paying for is C & D Meats when they're there).
Infinitely better quality and many more vendors.
The problem isn't the quality, it's the quantity.
