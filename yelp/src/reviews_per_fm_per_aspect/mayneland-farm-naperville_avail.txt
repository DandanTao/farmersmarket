The tomatoes are the high point of the season for me.
Last night I had a chopped tomato over burrata with fresh basil, olive oil, salt and pepper-- heaven.
They have a bountiful selection of the freshest veggies and fruit; absolutely the most gorgeous tomatoes!
Their stand has large and small Red onions..they had purselane and dandelion greens and several varieties of lettuce...and as I was leaving I was invited to sample a wedge of melon.
Cute little farm to hold you over during the week in between Saturday Farmer's markets!They have fresh veggies and fruit and strawberries that actually taste like strawberry!
