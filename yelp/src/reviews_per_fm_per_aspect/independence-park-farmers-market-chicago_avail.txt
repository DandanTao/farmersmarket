Great selection.
They have all the fresh fruits and vegetables that you would expect.
Definitely a step up from the farmer's market I usually frequent in North Center at Damen and Lincoln.There were quite a few vendors selling everything from dog treats to cheese to produce to meats.
Also, though there was great variety in goods offered, there was usually only one booth selling a certain item - so one booth selling cheese, one booth selling jelly.
The vendors represent a decent assortment of fresh veggies, local baked goods, soaps, tea, etc.
There's an excellent selection of produce, baked goods, even organic meats and ice cream.
There are a ton of vendors to shop at: Jeanette's Patisserie, Ruth & Phil's Gourmet Ice Cream, and other stands including handmade pasta, Nun's bakery that feeds the homeless, Sweet corn etc etc.
Maybe some vendors had already packed up, but I would have liked to see more produce.
There were other stands with baked goods, kettle corn, candles, etc.Non-vegans might like the gourmet doughnut stand.
I am hopeful that the Wisconsin organics farm returns for a second year at Independence Park, although there are several farmers from the south suburbs and Berrien County, Michigan that bring some lovely fruit and vegetables.
Fair selection of produce, but this farmers market has a lot of baked goods, cheeses, organic doggie treats, fresh noodles, organic meats and even ice cream and crepes!
The produce is fab and there are some great unique vendors - like the coffee stand, waffle booth, and the knife sharpener (!)
