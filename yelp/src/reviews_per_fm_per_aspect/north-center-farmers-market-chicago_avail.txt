Wonderful selection of fruits and vegetables.
Worth a stop if you haven't been (go early for best selection, obviously).
There's a good bread shop as well as a cheese vendor too.
This year there is a new vendor from Altorf, Illinois called John Bailey Farms/ they have 3 types of outstanding honey as well as jellies & pickled goods!
While I'm generally a quality over quantity guy, when there's not much of a selection, this is a real problem.
It has everything I need and I load up every week on fruits, veggies, fresh eggs and flowers.
One of the most over looked, but, action packed, restaurant and culture filled neighborhoods, North Center, is even home to, and proud to present our own Farmer's Market.While it's not as large as others (based on the fact that our 'town square' isn't that large, there is always a wide selection of items, from cheese, to breads, to fruits to veggies, and always something special.It's nice to walk out the front door to the North Center Farmer's Market on Saturday mornings and see the buzzing of neighbors, kids in wagons, and families stocking up on local grown goods for the week.
Plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables and herbs (berries, peaches, tomatoes, basil, peppers, etc.), bread, artisanal cheese, free range eggs, and the best fresh, natural frozen yogurt/ice cream I've ever had.
They still have the baked goods (at a higher price this year), fresh flowers, a smallish selection of fruits and veggies (I think the biggest vendor has pulled out this year), as well as the cheese and some jams.
