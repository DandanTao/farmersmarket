Lots of free parking.
Support local businesses!
Eating an extremely reasonably priced and delicious prosciutto sandwich.
Great insulation.Behind the Scenes Mushroom Tour -- slight discount if you take both tours.
There was a lot of things in progress but there were two bakeries up and running.
The staff were very friendly and clearly knowledgeable.
Though they're still working on expanding, this place had a lot of tidbits of knowledge. the tour had a decent amount of knowledge and it was cool of the random employees here and there to answer any questions we had.
I look forward to seeing how this place progresses as they seem to have a lot of big visions for this place.
Great ideas, poor followthru.
The people working here are doing amazing things for the city of Chicago and the community in which it sits.
There was music playing, food trucks serving, and tours of their building happening.
I also admire that instead making an effort to gentrify the community, the businesses that operate within the building are including community members to be involved.
Not quite what I expected from an organisation which advertised as "a small CSA we're able to provide exceptional customer service, so you are totally satisfied" when I cut the first $243 check.As result of the experience above, I decided not to pursue the remaining portion of the farm share, and asked to be reimbursed for the weeks ahead that I had already paid for but did not wish to receive.
It is unfortunate that a business would begin its life treating customers like this, and I felt it was important to share this story to help save people a similar frustration - not to mention lose out on a meaningful amount of money.
Great place to get away from the city life and stretch your green thumbs.
Volunteering is great fun.
