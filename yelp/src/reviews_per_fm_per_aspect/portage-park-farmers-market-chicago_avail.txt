The Portage Park Farmers Market is smaller than your Logan Square and Fulton Market varieties.
There's usually live music, vendors with fresh baked goods, tamales, crepes, local honey, jam, cheese, knife sharpening.
While there is *some* fresh produce available, the selection is very limited.
That's all fine and well, but what I'm looking for in a farmer's market is a good selection of fresh fruit and vegetables.
I make the trek to the Oak Park farmers market throughout the summer for fresh, local or nearby fruits and veggies.
And there's a lot of potential for this market to hit 5 stars.There's what I consider an average selection of vendors, although the number of options is improving.First thing.
