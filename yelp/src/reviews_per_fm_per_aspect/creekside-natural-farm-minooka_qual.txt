Best place to get free range organic-fed chickens.
Pam and Bill take such great pride in raising the chickens, and their organic produce.
It is great to find a farm nearby that cares about the food they grow.
I would give it five stars, except it is a bit pricier than the other cage free eggs and organic produce around.
Its nice to have a nearby place that sells locally-grown perishables.
