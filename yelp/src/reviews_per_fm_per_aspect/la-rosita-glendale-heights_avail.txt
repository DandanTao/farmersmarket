They have variety of tacos: Al Pastor, Asada, Chorizo, ChicharroÃÅn (green/red salsa), Tripa (upon request, not on their actual menu), Barbacoa & Cecina (weekends only), Chile Relleno.
Also, they have an excellent Mexican bakery at the front of the store, with an exceptional selection of treats.
They have a nice selection of meats and deli food.
They have a big bakery section, a nice selection of hispanic products, the aisles are big and very well organized.
Burrito contains meat, beans, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, sour cream, avocado slice... and cilantro on request.
Just had a few things to get and the selection was pitiful.
The meat market/veggie market is very very good.
The butchers are solid and the produce selection is top notch.
Quick service La Rosita has the biggest variety of Mexican food products, the best bakery, the best paletas, and definitely the best tacos.
The meat is questionable at best and the pantry items are on the expensive side.
