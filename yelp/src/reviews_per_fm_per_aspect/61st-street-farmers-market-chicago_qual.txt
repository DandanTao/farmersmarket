However, the produce is still really fresh and of good quality.
I totally dig that they also offer meat, eggs, and dairy, also produced locally and organically.
The number and quality of offerings is outstanding, especially for the south side.
All of the vendors were friendly and helpful and the produce and baked goods looked fresh-as-can-be.
