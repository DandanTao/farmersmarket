There was ample parking for the guests (although this was a non-issue as many of the guests took shuttle buses).
The live music was setup right inside the sliding doors, so everyone could enjoy the full effect of the music no matter where they were.
The bar was setup inside for easy access.
What a great location.
Staff was great.
It felt like a fairy tale and my wife and I had the most amazing wedding.
