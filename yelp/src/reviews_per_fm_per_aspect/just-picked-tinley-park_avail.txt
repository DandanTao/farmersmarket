What looks like a little stand with a few items, it has a surprisingly large selection.
Corn, tomatoes, onions, peppers, potatoes, Garlic, Sugar babies!!!
Great bright red tomatoes, plum for sauce or regular for whatever.
Great sweet onions, perfect green peppers, peaches, plums, garlic, and smaller peppers.
Typically there are great tasting cubanelle peppers, hot banana peppers, and firm and easy to roast jalapenos.People come from miles around for the corn alone.
A couple garlic bulbs, plum tomatoes, a watermelon, usually a couple onions, etc.
