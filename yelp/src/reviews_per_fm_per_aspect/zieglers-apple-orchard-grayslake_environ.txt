Free parking and admission and apple picking.
Overall we had a good time picking apples and snapping a few pics; the staff was also very friendly and appreciative!
The orchard looks fairly small on the outside, but hidden inside are a lot more trees.
This place was serene and a newly found favorite place for my family.
I could have done without some of the mud, and parking was different, but I didn't have to spend the day and buy a buffet lunch I couldn't eat.All in all, a good place to pick apples and get back on the road!
If you are looking for a decent apple orchard with decent prices come check this place out.
I witnessed the owner (the smiling lady in the picture) being verbally abusive to the parking attendant, though.
Other places force you to spend tons for small bags of apples and a maze and some other stuff that I can do without.
Family owned and soooo many apples to choose from, and it's quiet and friendly and parking is easy.
If you want to pick apples, and avoid the crowds of people and you don't want to pay a lot for all the random frills this is your place to pick your apples!
A family run business, you definitely feel like you are supporting local farmers.
The ones that did remain were rotten, wormy, and small - golf ball sized!
The orchard is very small, only a couple of acres at most, so it didn't take much time to navigate the whole place.
My fiance and I were welcomed in (paying our little $1 entry fee) and told there was a lot already picked, but that there were plenty of apples to find.
The staff was very friendly as well.
