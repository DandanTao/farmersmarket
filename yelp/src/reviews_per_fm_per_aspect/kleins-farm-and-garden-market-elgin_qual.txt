They have the best sweet corn around, according to my wife.
The quality is good though, my petunias are still going strong; I have worked hard to keep them going too though.
I just got some really great fresh sweet bicolor corn here that was outstanding, and of course some fresh Wisconsin cheese curds, and Braunschweiger.
The quality and service at both locations is always excellent!
A stop at Klein's always makes me feel really good, whether it's for fresh asparagus, or a flat of marigolds for the garden, or whatever else they may have grown.
If you live in the area, do yourself a favor & don't buy fresh sweet corn in season anywhere else.
The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish they offered more organic produce rather than conventionally grown.
That being said, the produce is local (at least mostly) and extra fresh, noticeably better in taste & appearance than most grocery store produce.
The difference in taste between these fruits and vegetables and grocery store was quite remarkable.
There is nothing better than locally grown produce.
The sweet corn is to die for.
Might be a little pricey but you can count on the produce always being fresh.
We stopped for a healthy snack of fresh fruit while road tripping through IL.
