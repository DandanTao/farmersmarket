It was in very early spring, or maybe it was early summer actually, and there were very few vendors there.
Once the summer kicks in, there is quite a variety to choose from.The produce itself can be really really good or really underwhelming.
And there are a lot of vendors to choose from.
Great spot to get things like smoked fish, grass fed beef, local produce (somewhat limited, don't expect to get all your groceries, but things like mushrooms and potato are definitely here!).
There is, of course, lots of local produce and flowers, but there are also baked goods, candy, pasta, cheese, meat, fish, snack food, honey, soap, olive oil, tea, wine, as well as food vendors selling snacks to be eaten at the market.The winter market, despite the cold/snow and being much smaller than the summer market, was surprisingly good for its first attempt.
There was a good sampling of the above vendors, minus the produce.
I give the vendors that stuck it out in the cold a lot of credit!And now, for some of my personal favorite market vendors:-peaches and berries from the fruit vendor from Michigan-the cheese vendor from Wisconsin-the organic produce vendor from nearby Prairie Crossing-all sorts of apple goodness from an orchard in Harvard-addicting snack mix from Gurnee-yummy toffee from Cynthia's Sweets in Grayslake-baked goods (especially the olive rosemary bread and cinnamon buns) from Wild Flour Bakery in Milwaukee-pasta from Pasta Sue (especially the gnocchi) *and my most favorite: traditional French pastries made by a religious order of French sisters in Chicago.
