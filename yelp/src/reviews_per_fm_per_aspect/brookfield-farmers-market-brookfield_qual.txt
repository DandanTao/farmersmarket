Also has the best fresh roasted coffee anywhere.
The live music is nice (but loud), the library gives away free books, the French nuns make some awesome organic baked goods, and that coffee is delicious!
Absolutely delicious!
I usually go for the fresh produce and I was excited to see local farm fresh eggs!
You're paying more than if you went to your local store but supporting local famers and getting a more nutrient dense product is worth it to me.
I can always find some "unsprayed" produce and just love getting fresh picked red haven peaches every week!
Medium to light roasts means no bitter taste.
