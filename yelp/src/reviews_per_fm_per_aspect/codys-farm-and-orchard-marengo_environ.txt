The actual hayride to get to the pumpkins is free, so if you come with kids or just enjoy a ride that part is nice.They also have a nice apple orchard where you can pick apples for probably cheaper than most other orchards, and they have a very large corn maze!This farm doesn't have all the rides for children that some have, but there is a kid play area and they have some goats.
Everyone is very friendly and we will definitely be back!
My family and I were driving to Poplar Grove and found this farm store, which had a sign that read fresh Apple cider donuts!
The pumpkins are $6.00 each regardless of size!
You can't find that price anywhere in the city.
We had so much fun picking out the biggest, and the smallest pumpkins we could find.
What a wonderful group of people!
Really adds value to Marengo and the community.
