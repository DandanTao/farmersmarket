It has a petting zoo,pig races, corn maze, huge slide, lot of rides for kids, plus a big choice of pumpkins and tasty Apple doughnuts.Highly recommend this place!
It didn't taste like what I want a real, fall apple cider to taste...it was bland (my dad drank some and said it was weird).
They tried to pass their crappy corn harvest as being Indiana corn.
I guess they feel that it is better to leave your dog in the car, rather than to give him fresh air.
I'm always eager to have their roasted sweet corn and their apple donuts!
The produce in the barn is what you would expect--a splurge, but good quality.
Made fresh they have great flavor, the pumpkin was my favorite as it had that great spice that makes me think of fall.
Having to pay a buck for a standing parent to hold a PAID toddler on the carousel is a bit tacky, though.
I don't see why people try to give this place no stars to one star.
Just a few customers buying sweet corn.
I tried the watermelon one and it was delicious!
We were given tickets for each child and adult to enter the hayride and corn maze.
The apple cider donuts get 5 stars, the pumpkin ones are good too but only 4 stars ,they're not amazing.
However, I will go ahead and give a one-star review just because of the poor quality of customer service.
I don't look forward to venturing out all the way to Lincolnshire, but this is a good time for younger children.
While we ate tasty corn we got to watch the puppets dance.
Keep in mind that each thing cost roughly $2 in tickets to enjoy.There is also plenty of food including a section for organic, farm grown food.
The best part was the corn maze, because, to my surprise, we actually got lost in it.
