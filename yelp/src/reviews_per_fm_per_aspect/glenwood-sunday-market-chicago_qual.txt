I typically love this place buying fresh vegetables and talking to the vendors and friends at this weekly event; however today was an exception.
Bringing bags for scads of lovely fresh food.
It's certainly not the most economical way to buy meat, but it's incredible quality.
Organic & locally grown veggies & meats & goodies.
All of the farmers are organic growers or are in the process of transitioning to organic.
However, if your in Rogers Park and looking for quality local food products, the Glenwood Sunday Market is good, and hopefully keeps getting better.
Love this market I can walk out my door and buy fresh fruit and veggies for far less than I would pay at the grocery store.
Okay, the five stars are based on the fact that it's practically a stumble from my front door AND that it's a fantastic presence in the community.
Like previous posters mentioned, most of the products were sold out fast but it was due to a great turnout and good vibe.
It's all organic!!!!!!
