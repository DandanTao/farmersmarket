We had been eating more and more organic meat, but I still didn't feel that great about it.
Not only do I know exactly where our meat is coming from, but it tastes great.
Like what meat should really taste like.
The eggs are also delicious and we go through quite a few each month.Before Nature's Choice, my husband lived in fear that I would give up meat again, but with this quality of a product, he can rest easy that this won't happen.
I had never considered organic meat, figuring the stuff at the local grocery store was good enough.
Their meat has much more taste, less fat, and the animals are fed NO corn, antibiotics or hormones.
Grass-fed and free-range, it's the best of all worlds.
They have opened my palate to what real meat is supposed to taste like.
