However, if you're looking for the real deal without breaking the bank, this is the place to go!
Great small-scale spot in the back of La Rosita.
Great amount of meat on both.
Very impressive.Two other things - they do offer chicharrones in the sheet format here, though they don't seem to be a great value as compared to places like Carnitas Uruapan in Pilsen.
Good prices.
On top of that, the price was ridiculous.
This grocery store always has gud prices & the Taqueria is really gud.
Low prices in the grocery store as well and good prices on beer.
Everything is so good and they give your great portion sizes.
Elotes is great!
The taqueria is fine but it's prices are higher than what I see at most similar places and the tacos are not as tasty.
Great tacos, but a little overpriced, no guacamole, but they have avocados slices.
It's not a hard place to find and has a spacious parking lot.
Thanks to La Rosita my family is able to have the same meals as they would in Mexico.
Not to mention, the staff is young and extremely polite.
The carneceria is good, the guys are really friendly, and I've done well by the meat there, but Valli is right down the street as Tobin has already mentioned.
"2014" I like this store I find a lot what I seek when making Mexican foods for my family.
