Fun place to shop for pumpkins.
Super cute!
Randy's is a fun place to visit during the Halloween season, just be sure to pack your wallet.
We waited 20 minutes in the parking lot and they never opened.
Then I took my son there to have a fun day to find out the rides are only available during the weekend.
Okay I understand it because school is in session but there are still moms that have preschoolers and while the weather is nice is looking for some fun things to do.
We go here every year for pumpkins but on top of that they have rides for the kids and a little vegetable stand inside.
I gave an extra star because the employees are friendly.
I feel as though this place is waiting for the land price to increase to the point where they can sell.
It's very expensive to buy things here.
