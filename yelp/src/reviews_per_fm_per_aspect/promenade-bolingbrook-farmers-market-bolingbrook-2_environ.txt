On the plus side: local farmers, local businesses, live band, kids' activities, on the premises of The Promenade Bolingbrook mall - so plenty of parking plus if you need to shop at the mall you can do both.
Lots of people, which is great!On the not negative side: in our eyes, a farmers' market should promote local, family-owned, small businesses, not huge corporate chains.
Bands and music setup is great for a Thursday night.
Great hot sauce stand and an excellent jelly maker at least this week.
Cherry tomatoes were $3.50 and $4 respectively at the two vendors.There were around 20ish stalls in all, and I thought a lot of it seemed over priced for what it was.
And the choice was small.
