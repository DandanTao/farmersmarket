Like many of CBG's community farming sites, this farm is lovingly maintained by staff, volunteers, and community gardeners to produce wholesome food for their communities.The site takes up just a few city blocks but is a lovely little area of nature among crowded home sites and buildings.
There is street parking available and a lot (undesignated) to the south side of the farm, with free parking in both areas.
Farming sites are available for rental to community gardeners, and food is grown here for WIC program boxes, farmers markets, CSA and local restaurants.
This land is well maintained, supports multiple agricultural incubator businesses, and helps to manage the community allotment garden associated with the property.
