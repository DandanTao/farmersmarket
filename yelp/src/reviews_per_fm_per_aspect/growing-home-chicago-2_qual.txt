Growing Home offers an excellent CSA box.
Overall, their veggies are fresh and flavorful.
You can feel great about supporting this farm when you buy your CSA. what's not to love about delicious, organic veggies AND transitional employment for people in areas with limited options? this place is amazing and always my first stop at the farmer's market. their egg shares are great as well, but you'll be hooked. even the "best" eggs from whole foods have nothing on these beauties.
