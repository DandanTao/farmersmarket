They also have a cute little store out front that sells candles, soaps, cider, pre-picked apples, sweet corn, and other random veggies from the farm.
We got some corn kernels for popcorn, some fresh cider, and apple cider donuts! :) Also, there's an apple orchard, a corn maze, and a fun kids area.
Great vegetables, pumpkins, and other things.
