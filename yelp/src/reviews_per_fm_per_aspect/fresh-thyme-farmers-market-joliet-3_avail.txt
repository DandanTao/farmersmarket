I'm not sure why these companies go this route when they branch into the Midwest, but they do and while other people might not notice, they're not fooling me.I've been a huge advocate of Sprouts when I lived in Texas because the prices and selection were outstanding...
Some varieties of the tomatoes and apples should've made it straight to the garbage.I will say that FT was actually quite large.
Perhaps in the spring-fall their produce selection will be better, but I'm not keen on playing vegetable roulette.
I like shopping at this store because of the fresh produce and organic selection.
The only problem I have had is that the meat counter isn't always stocked especially with sale items.
Love their variety of foods and drinks from all over the world.
Might start with the bison hot dogs and see where this goes...Bulk Dry Goods -- The variety of candy caught my children's eyes (how many types of chocolate or yogurt covered pretzels can there be?), but I also enjoyed the variety of dry goods.
Best selection of produce items in the area including some places that are strictly geared towards produce.
Definitely the best vegan, organic, non-gmo, selection the area, with brands you can't find anywhere but Whole Foods at about half the price.
They also have a large selection of pre made food options which I picked up for a quick dinner.
On Wednesdays they have last weeks same items and the current week sale items both out there for us to purchase.
The fruits and veggies are all top shelf.
Good selections, particularly with supplements.
It's like a mini-Whole Foods but with better prices!!Wonderful variety of fresh produce.
Huge selection of cheese, wild meats, and an olive bar.
There is a small by adequate selection of by the pound spices, too.
I love your stores variety and options but you guys have the worst prices I have seen anywhere around here.
They also have a wonderful variety of specialty dry goods to accomodate folks with a wide range of dietary needs.
Since then, there is always either one up front or someone will get me one without even having to ask.They have a great selection of produce and I love the bulk section!
They have the best prices on fresh healthy options, their produce is above all others and their vitamin selection is wonderful, and their prices ALWAYS beat others.
Their selection of more wholesome, less-toxic, "green", and organic products is just what I'm looking for.
We have a few specialty items we buy weekly, that we cannot find at regular grocery stores.
They have those things and a great selection of other yummy stuff.
They have a great selection of natural/organic products, a lot better than what you'd find at a normal chain supermarket.
