One of the baked goods suppliers is an abbey which means you will be buying from nuns.
Generally speaking even though this is not an extensive farmers market, it is an extraordinarily wonderful source of high quality super tasty food items.
The fresh lemonade is fantastic as well.
Gotta Bee Crepes usually makes an appearance (with a very long line for amazing, fresh crepes) and the knife sharpener is fun to watch.
Outstanding blueberries, cherry butters, freshmade flavored hibiscus tea, made to order crepes, French pastries, organic meats, etc.
It's an experience, not just a great place to get farm fresh produce and artisanal foods.
All their produce is top quality as well.
I've tried the Hawaiian (ham, cheese, pinneapple, bbq sauce) and Nutella crepes - both were tasty.
It was good, but not $6.00 good.
I bought my daughter a butter croissant at one of the bread stands and it was so delicious and buttery (wish I remembered the name!)
