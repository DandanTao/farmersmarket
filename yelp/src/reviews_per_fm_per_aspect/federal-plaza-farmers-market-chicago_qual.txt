For now it is asparagus, fresh "Siam Queen" Thai basil from Smits Farms is of a much better quality with larger leaves than I have found in other places in Chicago.
The highlights for me are the Amish food stall (amazing cookies and cheese - get the habanero cheese) and any fresh produce.
I got some really lovely purple asparagus, the first Michigan strawberries of the season, and some great spinach that stays fresh for a looooong time.
It's well worth the trip and getting up a littler earlier than usual.TIP: Pick up some baked goods at Misericordia's Hearts & Flour Bakery; not only does it support a good cause, but their cookies are pretty damn awesome!* That's right I called it the SEARS Tower, as it is and forever shall be in my mind.
Mmmmm, fresh produce a block away from the office!
I thought the mushroom tent was unique, they make their own mushroom veggie patties that are soy-free and (I think) are gluten-free as well.
I bought fresh sweet onions (the smell amazing), a huge bunch of fresh basil, zucchini, raspberries and strawberries, along with arugula lettuce.
I also got a bag of dried cranberries and cherries from Michigan--YUM!
The fresh fruit tastes amazing.I love that the food is free of chemicals and all the crap that gets put in it from commercial vendors.
The jams were delicious!
Sure, the prices are a bit steep (compared to the standard products found on regular grocery stores), but still cheaper than buying them from organic food shops ----- no middle man!Minus one star b/c it closes too early - 3pm!
I live in a high-rise condo and have no outdoor space to grow things.
It is great to buy produce directly from the growers.
Unfortunately right now it is primarily flowers and plants right now- which smell and look great but probably do not taste too good!
