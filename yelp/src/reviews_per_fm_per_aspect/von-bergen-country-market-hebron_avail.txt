But it was only recently that I discovered this little gem while taking a back road.Von Bergen is everything you could love about fresh fruit and vegetables.
I had peaches here (from Michigan) that probably ranked up there as being the best ever.
Just cook and enjoy.They also sell home baked pies, some jellies and breads which I haven't tried yet but they look so good.
