The wine and beer selection is amazing given their size, but that is certainly not the only good thing about Farmer's Pride.
Fresh herbs, locally sourced fresh breads and coffee beans, kombucha, Kashi cereal, Ben and Jerry's ice cream, organic milk, free range eggs, multiple kinds of tortillas and sometimes even fresh tamales or baked goods by checkout.
And the LaCroix variety is really top notch .
It's all here, delivered by the most genial merchants in town.
After we'd gotten most of the produce, the clerk came and asked if I was still looking for fresh bread as they'd just gotten a delivery from the bakery that makes their bread.
We're literally always greeted with a warm smile and a genuine hello.Now onto the selection...
For a relatively small grocer, the selection is really impressive.
Their vegetable and herb selection are also pretty wide while still managing to be fresh.
We didn't expect them to have fresh fennel for a fennel / apple salad, but they did.
Great selection of groceries, meats, and produce.
Good selection of organics.
Great selection of meatless meats.
Quality produce, decent selection of meat, great coffee, all the fun ethnic things that come in jars and cans (for real, it's almost shocking how they seem to always have that one ingredient you need), D'amato's bread, organic items and now they have beer and wine too!
They have had everything I've ever needed-- from macaroni pasta to specific produce to lime juice.
They also have a great selection of local beers and gluten free options.
