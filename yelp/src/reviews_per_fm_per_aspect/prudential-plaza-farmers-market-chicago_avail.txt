Lots of fresh produce - corn, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, mushrooms, squash, peppers, apples, berries, and much more.
There is a lot of variety here.I've also purchased jarred goods here.
The homemade portabello mushroom pasta sauce was one of my favorites.
You get get honey, fresh bread, pastries, jam, and flowers here, as well.
You can get flowers, fresh produce, and even fruit pies and preserves produced in the area.
That is 4-star-worthy.To give an idea of prices, I spent $35 on two little cartons of strawberries, one of snow peas, one of snap peas, a container of fresh mozzarella, a loaf of pretzel bread, four stems of peonies and four stems of lilies, and a little mint plant.
I am looking forward to a summer of doing weekly veggie & fruit shopping here!
