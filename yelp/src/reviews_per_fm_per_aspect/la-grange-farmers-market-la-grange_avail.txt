I counted only three farm vendors, but their quality and variety are strong enough that you should find top-notch wares to suit almost all needs.The bread and butter of this market is really specialty foods: wine; olive oil; cheese; chocolates; eggs; meat, poultry, and fish; loose-leaf tea; jams & jellies; salsa; kettle corn and flavored popcorn; and of course bakeries, bakeries, bakeries.
