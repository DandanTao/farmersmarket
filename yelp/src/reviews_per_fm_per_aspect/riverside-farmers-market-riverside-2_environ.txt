While parking can be questionable at some locations the regular and handicap parking here seems plentiful within the the square and the entire area has both a true small town feel and also a big local park feel with trees and flowers.
Some people I've spoken to treat a Farmers Market like a bartering flea market but I find the quality to be high and prices reasonable and don't think that it's appropriate to ask a farmer or baker to lower their price when they have put some high labor in to their products.
This Farmer's market is small but cute.
Very small market, some baked goods, vegetables, etc.
A great market.
Why even go to Oak Park and try and find parking, we have it all right here.
Great programs every week.
The Raw kale chips, and toxin-free bug spray is a nice addition.
Great location for taking a hike along the river and getting great local foods.
Great, friendly vendors and surprises every week!
