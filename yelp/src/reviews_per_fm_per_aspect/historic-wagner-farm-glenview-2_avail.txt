I have also been to the farmers market and they have a nice selection of vendors.
Also, the meat vendor gets a bit testy if you ask about the provenance of their meat.
They have your usual fare, REALLY good apples at the end of the season as well as apple butter, and great bread.
The apples looked really good, and there were varieties I had never heard of.
Lots of vendors and fresh fruit.
We bought some squash and guessed the weight of an enormous pumpkin.
