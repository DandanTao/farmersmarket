We've had cider donuts many places, but no one does them like Edwards!
There's also a great cafe on the lower level, where you can get apple pie, cider, coffee, hot dogs, or pull-pork sandwiches.
All is delicious and reasonably priced.Outside on the grounds is a kid area, complete with play equipment.
If you are looking for a ton of things to do outside apple picking, this is not the place for you--and that is what I love about this place.
There are some ponies to ride and a free playground for the kids.
It's cash/check only so be aware of that, but they do have an ATM on site.This is def a must-go if you are looking for a good family orchard without all the extras!
They are well staffed and incredibly friendly and organized.
I've had cider doughnuts from other places, but none were as good as theirs.
The line might look long and deceiving but it actually went pretty fast and the staff was super friendly.
I've been to the different types of it or apple orchards this is a little bit smaller than a typical ones that I would see closer to the city of Chicago but it was still a must-see.
I wish the petting zoo was a little bit larger there was only turkeys chickens and goats.
Arrived around 9:15am, still ample parking.
The price was $43 for a basket ($3 deposit if u want to return the basket, we kept ours).
Pumpkins were $4 and $8 (only two prices) depending on the size.
It was great.
The line to get into the parking lot was literally a mile long when we left.
Parking was easy, I could have spend all day browsing through the store and eating donuts.
We went to sample their wonderful items and all samples are put away at 3:30.
For out of town visitors they need better signs leading to the location.
Fun for all ages.
They have a photo opportunities, children's play area, pet viewing area, goat feeding area, corn maze.
Sometimes live music!
Cash only and gets very crowded in the afternoon hours!
There's the play area for kids--pirate ship, play houses, play train, tractors to play on.
There's also pre-picked apples and a small array of cheeses.
There's the bigger cafeÃÅ where you can get a meal.
The area is huge, well-laid out and totally country cute.
Although I think the prices are a little higher than what we pay for apple picking--but you gotta pay for the upkeep.
Every person working here that I spoke to was super nice and helpful.There was a nice crowd, but it's early in the season...I can see how this place can get packed easily.
This scene is definitely not for me, but I do appreciate what they have available and see that it can be a fun trip.
Cash is king! but they do have ATM's located in the stores in case you don't have enough green.
The barn, the music everything else is a family favorite but the baskets for apple picking have gotten smaller and price is $48.00 a basket.
This place is hugh with plenty of parking.
Give it a try you will enjoy this place with the kids.
We parked quickly, got on the tractor quickly, everything was great.
This isnt some small farm where you pay for what take.
This place has the best apple cider donuts.
Of course, all apple cider donuts at apple picking places taste great.
The lunch here is expensive.
It's a great place.
And dont come late. *** CASH ONLY ***Still great, and a fun day for a wander around with a helpful staff who always seems cheery despite the large crowds.
People watching is amazing as well, big slice of Americana. $40.00 a basket of apples, big gift shop all sorts of things including their famous warm doughnuts, plenty of other delicious foods choices as well. *** CASH ONLY *** Edwards is the classic Apple Orchard.
Also a great play area for the kids and tractor rides....too much to post it all.
A great family tradition, be sure to have your picture taken under the arbor with the year above.
There was a lot of people there already.
It's cute.
Some where huge and other apples small.
I have twin 5mo babies, and we brought a stroller to push them around the Apple orchard rows, but were told when we got there that there were no strollers allowed.
Great flavor.
Ambient is great.
Great place for kids to come and play, great place for family fun.
It's specially designed for toddlers I think, and there's also a cute petting zoo but other than that not much to do for older kids.
These apple cider donuts are worth the hour and half drive from Milwaukee.
And bring cash, because they don't take plastic.
It is a great place and very manageable for kids .
The place is cash only.
Great place.
Worth the hour drive but getting there when it opens is the best plan of attack!CASH ONLY.- NO CREDIT CARDS I was hesitant to review hoping my family was the only group that received shameful treatment by the staff, but after losing sleep over it and reading many reviews, it is clear that is not the case.
That staff was unnecessarily rude to my family and was completely unwilling to accommodate our mid-sized group.
My extended family drove from many hours away to enjoy a nice day together, but the staff had absolutely no care or consideration.
His perceived racism and support of his staffs behavior was quite frankly shocking.
He made it very clear that the discontent and treatment of my family were of little concern to him because they service "15,000 other visitors each day anyway."
Although the grounds provide for a lot of fun activities, especially for the little kids who loved the day, there are too many other options for picking apples and pumpkins to visit a place that cares more about profit than customer experience.
I recently found out some not-so-great news & what this has done for me has been very positive in many ways because I'm really soaking up my life & the people in it.
They certainly have a great set up here: beautiful country surroundings, a picturesque apple orchard and plenty of stuff to do for the whole family.
The energy and vibe of this whole place was excellent.
Everyone was so friendly and helpful.
The wagon ride was fun because you got to see the whole orchard.
It wasn't very long but very fun nonetheless.
Apple picking is at the East end of the FREE parking lot.
You pay at the small shed, grab your bushel & hitch a ride on the tractor.
We found a small maze made up of wire fencing & let me tell you, it was difficult!
We stopped somewhere else on the way out to Edwards so I didn't look at pricing but everything was very reasonable here, so I feel confident saying the pumpkins probably are reasonably priced, too.
There is lots of parking, again, it's FREE so in case you are trying to cram your whole group in a car too small, don't hesitate to bring the extra vehicle.
Breakdown of pricing I found important:-BRING CASH or Check.
No credit cards accepted here!!!-Entrance/Parking: FREE-Wagon ride: $4 pp-Apple picking: $40 per bushel + $3 deposit for bushel. 1 bushel min. for groups up to 6 (I believe); 7+ people: 2 bushel min.
Despite this act of God, the family rebuilt and continued the family business that all have grown to love generation after generation.
All kids activities arefree, unlike the Apple Holler.
The kids have plenty to do with a small petting zoo, straw jumping barn, and corn maze.
Super expensive and very aggressive staff.
Parking was easy to find.
A kids play area complete with petting zoo and tractors to climb on.
This is a CASH ONLY establishment.
Visiting this place has been a family tradition since I was a tot!
There was way too many people and not enough places to sit.It took us 30 minutes to park, and exit lanes were blocked.
Someone definitely needs to manage the parking better.My recommendation would be to add more order and efficiency to everything here.
I fly in from CA to visit my friends and family and this is the PERFECT place to haul back souvenirs.
Edward's Apple Orchard has meant family fun for me since I was a little kid.
Everything from the abundance of parking, to the new and improved ordering line, to the big red jug seats, to the maze...just...everything.
They've got an amazing play area for kids, accompanied by a decent little petting zoo with the cutest baby goats I've ever seen (I haven't seen many).
The walking maze is as fun as ever no matter how old you are, and they always seem to be adding another model building or tractor to the play area.
I'm serious, this place is a dream land to kids.
The shop has expanded exponentially and is a great place to kill a little time out of the sun.
This place is great!!
Friendly staff.
Good prices and with every turn comes a new sample to try!
Served warm with a perfect blend of exterior 'crust', soft chewy inside and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.Charming barn shopping with an excellent assortment of jams, dips and snacks available for purchase to take home.Friendly staff ready to help, along with the local police on site to patrol traffic and pedestrian crossings.Will be back!!!
The kids love the pony rides, animals, and the play area, and maze.
It's awesome to see the kids sharing the same memories I did.
It also seems that every year we come, price increases as customer service and bucket size decreases!!
I just wished that the employees Mr. Edward employed were half as customer oriented as he is.
Even as the orchard is, it is still an excellent and family friendly orchard for all shapes and sizes.
It gets so crowded on the weekends!
Great time for the family, just come with a lot of money and patience.
It is a family Event that you can enjoy for a few hours even when it's crowded it's always nice.
The staff is always friendly and there is plenty of parking and it never feels shoulder to shoulder (like in the city).They have a really cool gift shop.
They sell home made fudge, fresh apples or you can pick apples from the orchard, there are barns, arts and crafts, pony rides for the kids, small country style outdoors play area for with tractors, slides, trains; there's a eatery downstairs with hot (or cold) apple cider, apple pie, hot apple donuts Edwards Apple Orchard East is a great place to pick apples, take kids to play, shop, and eat delish food!
Great place to go during the fall!
Cash or check only, NO Credit CardsThe BEST apple cider donuts ever.
It is free to get in and my son loves playing in their play area.
So much to choose from.Apples,fudge, donuts, cider and much more.Not to mention the wonderful women I went with.We are family & friends who have love for one another thru thick and thin.Very grateful for this experience.
A little pricey but always a fun spot to visit each Fall.
Great environment, delicious donuts and a lot of family activities!
Just make sure to watch prices because it does get extremely pricey.
It's an apple orchard, and we rarely buy apples because of the price.
The highest price of any orchard I've been to.
There is soo much to do like apple and raspberry picking, pony rides, big playground with pirate ships to play on and tractor tires to climb on, a petting zoo, and a great grill for lunch.
You can go with up to 6 people so the average per person is only a little higher than a grocery store, plus you get a fun tractor ride to the trees.
Quaint, cute & charming.
They have a large children outdoor play/park area with great props.
The store on the inside is nice to browse but extensively overpriced items lurking everywhere.
They typically have a band, blue grass like music playing for the festivities that gives the atmosphere a nice touch.
They also have small pony rides that are for primarily children 50lbs and under, I seen a poor heavy set child denied a ride.
Parking is free and the best time to go is during the week when everyone else is gone.
Chris and I spent a nostalgic drive to the place she and her family came regularly during her youth.
Crowded with kids, grandparents and young marrieds, only enhanced my experience.
There was a local group playing on a hay wagon stage that overlooked a picnic area.
Petting zoo in one of the many buildings with great staff at every turn to help in any way.
Hot dogs and pork sandwiches will help balance the fudge and Carmel corn with the apples to keep the kids going.
This place is very well organized but overpriced.
The staff was friendly and it had plenty of free parking.
The prices are high, or at least from what I remember from other "you pick orchards", $40 per basket and it's a mandatory basket per group of six (and children count towards the six) but the wagon ride was fun and the apples were delicious and they also have raspberry and blueberry groves you can pick too.
The store has a lot of great products at decent prices but the winners are definitely the donuts and the caramel corn nuggets.
I gave it two stars because of the price and because it was very over-crowded but it was our first visit and our last.
Staff very friendly and helpful. pull all of the samples early to wash the dishes arrived at 410 they are open until six this is part of the reason I go not to sound cheap but I have 3 boys that wera also disappointed huge wasp nest in play area donuts still good but definitely a let down I have gone to Edwards Orchards for more than 10 Years and have taken many friends with me, we have always had a blast.
The Apple doughnuts, hot/cold cider, pulled pork sandwiches (my personal favorite) are all very good and there's no experience like Edwards but I don't think I'll be going back because the prices have become too high for me and my family of four.
One of my favorite places may have priced me out.
As long as you don't miss the crowds of people, live music and wagon rides, this is the type of day to go on.
They even have people walking you to your car from the store with an umbrella so you don't get wet- adorable.
This place cages baby animals in small pens for visitors to enjoy.
Family fun, and who doesn't love an orchard in fall?
Lots of family fun here!
I went with a friend for apple-picking and found a cute shop with fresh apples and other edibles, a museum, an area with animals, a pony ride, and a small restaurant.
Everyone was very friendly and helpful too.
( cant remember exact terms and conditons on baskets & price etc ) That kind of sucked I liked it when you got a basket and filled it as much or as little as you wanted.
It's such a great place to go to.
They have apple picking, pony rides, a play area for children and so many other great things.
This is not a great practice @ $9.00 a dozen.Thanks.
As someone who grew up in a rural area with apple trees in their yard, the quaint charm of the place is pretty lost on me.
We didn't have to wait much of a line for anything and the place was packed.
Take ur Family!
When I question his beaver and told that we feel weird with him following is, he told us to take out business to a different orchard of we don't like it .
This was supposed to be a family memory to share...sadly .
You have to change the policy , respect people and stop been very greedy with such as high $prices Edwards is my favorite place to visit in the fall.
Will definitely be returning each fall with the family This place was so much fun.
Like most orchards it is a little $$ but I feel like it is worth it to support local growth and such a fun experience.
Fun place to go in the fall.
Since then, the place has added and added.
Great place to go if you are really in for it for the apples.
Even though it was extremely crowded, the staff is good at getting people through the lines quickly and I was suprised that we had practically no wait for donuts or to check out, despite the long lines.This year we couldn't pick apples, they said they only had about 50% of their usual crop and we got there the day after a frost, so we couldn't pick berries either.
The crowds are long sometimes but its a seasonal place.
The things they make like the cider and fudge etc are the things to get anywayGreat for kids The older I get, the less I like my home state of Illinois.
It's an expensive place to live, it's grossly mismanaged, and traffic is a nightmare in the summer.On the other hand...
Pros: Easy parking, good cider, great donuts.
We were trucked there in groups and watched over constantly by a group of staff we started calling the Apple Minders.
Small bags of very overpriced apples are available in the orchard store.The shop was massive, overpriced, and cash only.
Most of the goods were not local, including the produce and preserves.In general it was extremely crowded and busy, full of rules (NO SINGLE DONUTS TO GO!
There are easier, friendlier, cheaper, and and more fun apple-picking experiences in the area.
Love this place, very children-friendly and their donuts are perfectly made!
I prefer to go on a early weekday because then its not super crowded as it is on the weekends.
The shop is amazing and I love how they have samples of alot of items.
The apple barn has great samples!
I also enjoy how they added the barn outside for food and the inside eatery becomes crowded quick.
This will be something I plan to do the rest of my life as long as I live close Great donuts and cider it's just always busy.
The prices are not to bad and there's always a good band.
Just the right balance of carmel, nuts, dark chocolate, and salt that kept it from tasting too sugary (an issue I have with fudge).They have live music, usually bluegrass, on the weekends.
There are pony rides, animals to pet, playgrounds, and other things to keep the kids entertained.
So, be prepared for huge crowds on the weekends.- They don't take credit cards, so have your cash or check book ready.
The orchard is SUPER busy and if crowds aren't your thing, I don't know that I would recommend this place.
The baked potato tent is great.
The fudge is great.
The gift shop is great and they do have GF products.
Donuts are getting smaller but still fantastic.
This place is probably one of the most nostalgic places in Illinois for me.
Ever since I was a little girl, my parents have been getting me up at the crack of dawn to drive out to Poplar Grove for Edward's amazing cider donuts.
Don't knock it til you try it, it's amazing.Edwards features the cutest free petting zoo, ponies for the little ones, and hay rides if you're looking for some laid back family fun.
This family buisness is one of the best!
It is a fun family outing!
I had a great time, great food and great company.
The staff is friendly and helpful the food is simply delicious and fattening.
I felt like a little kid watching her first snow fall.
This orchard is about an hour west of where I live so the anticipation builds as we leave suburbia for a small town feel and country life.
Ample parking + staff members to direct said parking = no parking headaches for this girl.
They have a store located inside a barn with tons of potential purchases including freshly made fudge (they let you sample it before you buy it... the amaretto is a must try), apple butter, crafts to make your home feel all cozy inside, candles, and so much more.
This place is awesome for people of all ages.
Their prices are ridiculous now. $8 for 1/2 peck?
Pluses: easy parking, no admission fees, ascetically pleasing, fairly priced and good food, kind peopleMinuses: crowded, lines everywhere, property layout felt tight, kids area lacking, no hay bales, no direct interaction with animals (had to feed goats through a tube), no corn maize, no pumpkins, and the worst of all - the main reason we went - was the pick your own process.
You are confined to a minuscule portion of the orchard crowded with people, given a basket you are required to buy ($3) and fill to the top ($30 - $35), and we only had access to a single apple type - gala.
I'm not even joking, there were at least 50 people in line waiting to get into the area where you buy gifty/foody items.
The actual apple picking was fun and their trees had tons of apples, but the $34 minimum was pretty extreme.
My only complaint is how crowded it gets.
On weekends you can listen to live music while you wait.
It's a fantastic place for kids and the apples are always top notch.
Any opportunity to be pulled around by Clydesdales is fun, and the staff were very friendly, but I had hoped they'd drop us off at a pick-your-own outpost of some sort -- they didn't.One of the main attractions appears to be the store.
That said, I did end up buying a bottle of apple BBQ sauce, caramel corn puff things and a gallon of apple cider.I had fun, but I'm not sure it'd be worth the drive if I lived in the city.
This is not worth the drive from there.Too many great places closer and with more attractions.
They also have a small cafe in the basement with hot apple cider, doughnuts, and other sandwiches to consume while there.This has been a great place to go with the family for years and I cant wait to go next year.
The last time I was there (when I was a kid), it was a small operation.
The Jonathans were great - the trees weren't at all picked over and we filled up a basket pretty quickly!
There was a bluegrass band, big barn with lots of lunch-y type foods, a smaller snack shop with apple pie and apple donuts, and a shack that sold cider by the glass and bottles of water.
There were pony rides, hay rides, and lots of playgrounds for the kids.
All in all we had a lot of fun here.
What a great place!Love coming on weekends in October, although crowded, it adds to my experience AND most importantly....baked potato tent!!!
And make sure to bring cash or your checkbook, they do NOT take credit.Overall-Cleanliness: AFood: ALocation: APrice: BService: A---------------------Grade: A On Sunday, we took a drive northward towards the Wisconsin border for a day of apple picking and general autumnal fun.
The drive from Harvard, IL to Poplar Grove, IL is nice enough - we saw lots of farms and a handful of little villages; very Norman Rockwell.
The parking situation wasn't too bad - they have parking on either side of Centerville Rd and they have cops there to make sure the whole operation moves efficiently and safely.
We rarely have cash on us and use our debit card almost exclusively so this was a bit of an inconvenience.
The one thing Edwards does very well, compared with other orchards we have historically visited, is crowd control.
The rest of the store is like a giant Cracker Barrel which my wife loves - I had to hold my son so he wouldn't break anything.
So now you're armed with cash and can start 'having fun' - what else can you do?
There are lots of kids everywhere and their respective parents snapping pictures.
Cute trinkets, Christmas stuff.
Oh, and I love those caramel puffs.Crowds can be big.
It's big and has a few novelty attractions, but I didn't see much of a difference between this place and some of the smaller orchards in the area.
The place is OK, but if you have a local orchard, you're probably just as well off going there (especially if you are driving any distance to get to this one).
Weekends are pretty busy but its really a great place to be enjoyed!
Everything nearly was so over priced!
I bought food and cider for 2 people costed me over $20 HERE comes the fun part!
Location, Location, Location.
A family-owned apple orchard in the middle of rural northern IL.
There's a fairly large area for children to play and climb around, a fabulous gift shop in the barn and raspberries, pumpkins and apples you can pick yourself.
One thing to be aware of is it's cash or check only, no credit cards.
Easy parking and low lines; when the lines did get long, additional help seemed to be available.
The apple donuts were indeed great!
The apples were a bit pricey at $37/buschel but for a family where you're not paying parking, I think it's well worth it.
Music, good food, apple pickin - cmon, what more do you want!
Having gone here for decades, it would seem their prices have increased far beyond the rising prices in today's economy.
If you are disabled or physically challenged, bring a helper, as you will not be able to manage carrying anything if you use a cane and the very few benches are usually occuppied by donut eaters and kids, so there is no place for the physically challenged.
They do have ample handicapped parking, but it would seem to be filled by those affluent people from the suburbs with handicapped parking permits who seem to be free of disabilities.
