They have a good variety and are very affordable especially on the produce and meat.
If you need a bigger selection, I recommend the downers grove location.
And that the veggies / fruits are usually good (but not always).
Each item say organic apples or bananas are stocked just enough to sell.
They have a nice wine selection here too!
Excellent selection of cheeses.
Fresh Thyme has an adequate selection of fruits and vegetables, but I'm forced to go elsewhere more frequently than I'd like, because they often don't have produce that I need.
They have a good selection of healthy and fresh food.
The produce selection is phenomenal, local, and inexpensive.
Less busy and a larger selection of vitamins/supplements.
Previously my only local options were the merciless organic oligarchy price gougers Whole Foods and Fruitful Yield, or Trader Joe's, which I do like but they don't have the variety of the other two.
The deli are and bakery are a little limited as far as selection goes.
The bulk food area is fantastic: coffee, nuts, candy, honey, flour, grains, dried fruit, and granola ect.
The nearest Jewel is pretty ordinary and Whole Foods is a bit of a hike.The selection is what I would call "curated" rather than limited.
Very clean, nice selection of items.Even better prices for the quality of there item.
They have an assortment of olive oils, homemade peanut, almond, and cashew butters, and an extensive selection of nuts/grains/trail mixes.
Lots of organic and gluten free options, helpful workers and great bulk nuts and oils too.
Prices on other items make me want to shop elsewhere but this is my go-to veggie stop.
Great produce, great prices and selection.
It's a decent grocery store, though limited because of the size of the available space.
They mislabeled (and mispriced my selection) on one occasion.
