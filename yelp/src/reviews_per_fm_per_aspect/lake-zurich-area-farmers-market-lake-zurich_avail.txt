Fruits, veggies, knife sharpening, kettle corn, bakery (cookies mostly), pie place that has AMAZING lemonade in mason jars, a coffee place that has quite a variety for a farmers market stand!
(Thanks Apple Square.)Sometimes farmers markets can be disappointing in my experience; bad produce, lack of vendors, etc.
This one had a pretty nice mix of fruits & veggies, popcorn, a Mexican food booth, jams & condiments, meats, bread, soaps and a few other items.
And they give you curtido (pickled slaw) and a tomato sauce to throw on top.
