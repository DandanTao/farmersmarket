Product is setup on the back wall and you point to what you want and the wonderful courteous staff bags it up for you.
It's more fresh than other grocery stores around the area including schnucks, diebergs, and fresh tyme!
Whenever it's in season, the strawberries are so delicious and pineapple is super sweet.
I really appreciated that they let me taste test a few things that I wasn't sure about before I bought them.
My only disappointment is that they don't carry organic produce, except apples.
If they ever do carry organic produce I will be there every week.
You can really taste the difference from other store produce!
Everything is so fresh.
