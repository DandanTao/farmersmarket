The items for sale include, antiques, handmade items, baked goods, and produce, vintage items.It makes for a nice, relaxing day trip to spend time browsing the market.
The market is exactly as advertised - a bit of everything: antiques, vintage, crafts, produce & baked goods with emphasis on the antiques & crafts.
We were disappointed by the lack of produce options (There were only two vendors selling produce.) but enjoyed the bakery booth.
