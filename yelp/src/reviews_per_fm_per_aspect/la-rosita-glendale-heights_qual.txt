My dad used to bring us here as kids for cheap, authentic, delicious tacos.
Both were delicious.
Carnitas was very juicy and tender with good flavor.
Tried a bite and was surprised how juicy and good the flavor was.
This gem is tucked in toward the back of the store (after you make the first turn past the produce).
The food here is authentic and delicious.
They have a yogurt shop inside which also sells some yummy corn in a cup.
Their bakery serves fresh churros and their taco restaurant is on point.
Delicious tacos with plenty of meat!
The meat was undercooked and the flavor was bad.
These workers do a great job making great tasting Mexican food that has Flavor .
Their produced looked good from a distance.
DELICIOUS STEAK TACOS.
Very authentic and taste great.
Forget those chain restaurants The Taqueria inside this grocery store is delicious!
And I've had many Not a fancy place but if you want great food cheap fast and delicious, try it for lunch.
I've tried almost all their tacos and they are absolutely delicious.
They're a bit more expensive than other places but they stuff the tacos with meat, so it's worth paying a few extra cents.
The service wasn't the best because the man at the register looked bothered when I asked for foil to take one of my tacos to go but the quality in food will have me returning.
The food is (understandably) as fresh as can be, the tacos are so, so, so tasty, and everything is seasoned so well.
