There's an assortment of meats as well as jarred goods.
I'm assuming that the lack of variety is due to the current season and I understand that.
Hoping that spring/summer brings a little more of a selection.
This is a tiny store that sells Amish produce and other staples like cheese, jams and breads.
There isn't anything else like it in the area, so with it's limited selection, I guess it is what it is.
They're constantly expanding their selection.
The product selection and atmosphere was absolutely delightful!
They carry a nice selection of local, natural and/or organic produce, great cheeses, fresh real meats, eggs, dairy and sausages.
