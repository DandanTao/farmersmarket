There was numerous miscellaneous items but the concentration at this Farmers Market was the produce.
This farmers market is the best place to get fresh fruits and vegetables!
All the items were fresh and in great condition.He also ordered the Fruit My Cube for only $5.
They even have some other products, like Bobby's Custard, baked goods, and other misc. things.
You get a ton of fruit for the price, and it's great to have the variety of healthy snacks at your disposal without having to lug them into the office on your own.
I have been going here for years for all of my fresh fruits and vegetables.
