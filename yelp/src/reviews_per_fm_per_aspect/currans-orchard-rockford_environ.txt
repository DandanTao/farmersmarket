They have a little petting zoo for the kids, a hay maze and the worlds coolest idea, an apple sling where you launch over-ripe giant apples into a field to watch them explode with super-grossness.The gift shop is chock full of treats, and there is a counter where you can get fresh baked apple items and cider donuts.If you are looking for a family bonding experience, this is a great place to do it.
Having worked a cash register in my first job years ago I'm always polite to folks dealing with the public.
Cute pumpkin patch, some animals.
Smaller than other places, but perfect for a nice afternoon trip.
