They had all their usual vendors from fruit/veggie stands, meats, pet supplies, sweets, coffee, and other miscellaneous items from vendors.
YAY!!!First stop was the pet supply vendor for some grain free treats for our pup.
I bought tomatoes, cucumbers and peaches.
Tomatoes were overripped and peaches too sour.
Way better selection of produce and friendlier atmosphere all together.
I have been at markets in Wisconsin that are much more reasonably priced, but this is what you get in Lake County, Illinois.Overall, this is a fine farmer's market with a good variety and selection of vendors.
I get that Farmer's Markets are also a great place to sell other specialty items but the vegetables are the main thing I'm looking for.
I did buy some bratwurst from a meat vendor that was there and they had some good stuff available, but again it was pricey.
I understand that vendors need to charge more for their items but spending way more than I would at grocery store for the same items is a turn-off for me.
Beets from Horchers (picked the night before!) green beans and tomatoes from Madsen Farms.A few steaks for dinner from Farm Fresh Foodstuffs (they were out of skirt steaks, booooo) HUGE portabellos and delicious creminis, as well as pickled mushrooms from River Valley Ranch.I *think* that's everything.
