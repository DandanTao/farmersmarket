AND its pet friendly.
Now downside is parking is horrible but we are in a big city.
Overall, very busy, lots of hussle and bustle, dog walkers abs baby strollers everywhere, a quaint Market with lots of tents!
Lots of samples.
Vendors were very friendly and happy to answer questions and talk about their products.
Uh, ok, thanks.So where you order is where the menu/prices are.
Bought these beautiful flowers yesterday at the tent at the southwestern corner of the market and they are all droopy and dead already...not happy , especially because prices at the market are not the cheapest.
Definitely worth the price of the tickets.
This is a great Farmer's Market, especially that it is so close to the Zoo and great foods around the area!
Over 50 vendors and almost all had a sample of some kind (did I mention I love free samples?).
The front entrance booths are always the most crowded, but not necessarily the best bang for your buck!!!
And there is also a kids section--Club Sprouts--where they offer kids activities and food tastings for the little ones.
Thanks for the awesome customer service, guys; I really appreciate it.
Isn't that the reason people shop from local markets?
It's a nice sized market but when it gets crowded, it'll seem very small....I think it's to be expected that farmers markets will be have steeper prices than regular stores.
Parking is a premium but the market opens at 7 and paid parking doesn't start until 8, so we try to get there at 7 and get our shopping done in an hour so we don't have to pay.
It's big and has plenty of offerings.
If you are driving, there is metered parking on Clark, I've never had a challenge with finding a spot.
(especially early in the AM) I think it's great to support local farmers, buy fresh food etc.
Plenty of times I have seen farmers bringing substandard produce and charging high prices for it.
Also, people like me need to call out the bad ones, and call out the good ones.
They also have food vendors and I really think my husband only agrees to accompany me because he loves the bacon glazed cookie that the lovely chefs over at Cookies and Carnitas make! (They also have really great pork rinds!)Bottom line is Green City Market is an outstanding place to find local, seasonal food and support your local farmers.
I recommend going pretty early as it can get a bit crowded, especially if you're trying to find somewhere to park.
Live music.
A great place to sit under a tree, enjoy a sandwich, and watch the world go by!
I didn't buy much on this trip (the bike made it somewhat difficult), but I did pick up some flowers and fruit and both were high quality and priced right.A great farmer's market in the city and I highly recommend it!
And the guys slinging them are pretty cool too.It was worth the trip by itself, but the rest of the market seemed pretty anemic.
This place is really cute.
All of the vendors are very friendly, keep in mind that many of the vendors have a $10 min. for cards.
It was smaller than expected.
Parking is tough but I found a free spot!
Don't count on parking.
Brings lots of cash, you will spend it all.
He advised us that the largest compilation of vendors would occur at the Green City Market in Lincoln Park the following morning.
We were greeted by dancing toddlers surrounding a friendly man playing festive music on his bongo drum.
The adorable scene brought smiles to our faces before we even had the chance to see the delicious food stations we would soon encounter.
Obviously you can't go wrong, must try!-River Valley Ranch, Mushrooms, Pasta sauces, Spreads, SalsasI'm obsessed with their cheese spreads and the mushroom sandwiches you can get at the market.-Hoosier Mama Pie Co.-Crepe Stand The market organizers are always having great events to support the community and local farmers, events for kids and more so it's good to check their website or follow them on a social media channel to stay up-to-date.
It has a nice people watching scenes and many singles and families with kids.I love their crepes.
We sampled some peaches and had to get them.
Saturday morning crowd was not too bad.
This place is great!!
I had heard a lot about Green City so it was on my to-see list.Considering it is the biggest in the city, I was surprised by the size; it's not a heck of a lot bigger than the Temescal or Grand Lake farmer's markets in Oakland. and smaller than the KCC market in Honolulu.
More expensive than CA, which is and isn't surprising.Where Green City really whups CA is in dairy and meats.
I think every dog owner within a 5 mile radius is drawn to this place on the weekends.
If you don't like strollers, babies, and dogs I highly suggest you stay away as well.Even though I can't afford a lot, I like to go anyway.
If you go early, you should be able to find parking but after 10:30, you're basically SOL on that front.
They seem to up their prices at The Market.
It is in a great location though, with plenty of space to hang out on the grass and munch on your new purchases.
Yes, it can get crowded, but honestly, it's not unmanageable.
I went on a Wednesday and was told it was about half the size of Saturday's market, but I also benefitted from half the crowd size, and a Chef demonstration by Rick Bayless.Sr.
The farmers are only too happy to discuss it with you!There's free parking across the street from the Peggy Notabaert Nature Museum, or street parking on Cannon Drive.
He was very generous of time and spirit and is a great supporter of the City Green Market.
Also, if you like to cook, this place bestows great inspiration.
Finally, it's a perfect place to try something new.To be clear, I've never eaten at any of the food stands, so I have no review of them yet.The downside: Green City Market is not a secret. after 9am, when you combine all the strollers, people with their dogs, and oblivious cell users (I know, all three groups exist everywhere, but they all LOVE farmers markets, and flock to them like Larry "The Cable Guy" sprints towards terrible movie roles).
I arrived around 10AM and parking was crazy.
It was hot and I did not feel like circling around nor did I feel like walking a great distance in the heat so I parked my ride in the paid lot....which is $9 for 2 hours or less.
Talking to a few vendors I heard that the unseasonably cold weather and wind made them consider not setting up, so I'm assuming a number of other vendors weren't as brave.
The cheese was fantastic, I could've made a meal out of the samples alone.
The people working the stand were very friendly and I was impressed at how they made use of everything, even using biodegradable plates, etc. that would later be composted.
Despite the cold it was nice to sit outside and eat my lunch near a couple of musicians entertaining the crowd.
What I don't like about the Green City Market are the hippies and stroller moms doing drum circles in the middle of everything.
All of the vendors are amazing, and even when it's busy there is no shortage of places to sit in the shade and enjoy a purchase or two.
Everything is situated in rows with no real organization but that's half the fun!
Bring reusable bags too, the farmers/staff like that as do the rest of us environmentally conscious people!
Well parking is tricky and there is lot near by, but $9 at standard price for 2 hours with a discount to $5 if validated in the Green City Market, but I still think that is pricey.
You can park on the street for free until 9am.....IF you can find a spot.Next the prices were a bit high, but consider these folks are driving some distance to make it to this location I can understand if gas costs are baked into some of these prices.
It's open Wednesdays and Saturdays in the Southwest corner of Lincoln Park (you can park in the lot off Stockton at North Ave. and get your parking validated at their booth).
There was even music: a duo played folk tunes on a banjo and hammered dulcimer.
I love trying all of the new foods and meeting local small businesses.
The market is very family/stroller friendly and also pet friendly!
Parking is tricky so it would be easier to take the cta.
The prices are expensive here.
Not for weekly shopping but for the occasional extra special ingredients for summer cooking or on a fun lunch date, I think it's a wonderful local option.
Sure, I think I got ran over by like 2,436 strollers and stepped on by dogs of various sizes.
Public transit to the market is a must (Sheridan-151, Armitage-73, Clark-22 are the best options for a close-by bus stop).-Collect your reusable, eco-friendly bags (preferably your Yelp one to show off)-Wear your favorite label outfit, but not without forgetting extra deodorant and cologne/perfume (to mask the odor of some of the Hippie vendors who don't wear any)-Put on your extra large framed sunglasses to secretly check out all the good looking Lincoln Park/River North/Gold Coast yuppies.
Shop away!-Have your knives sharpened to create your own meals with all the items your purchased.-Get your watch battery changed in order to realize how much time you've spent at the market.Leave:-Head out feeling broke but great by supporting and promoting local, sustainable agricultural practices and businesses.-Next week, do it all over again!
Next time I will be sure to bring a tiny purebred dog in a purse, or alternatively, a large purebred dog on a leash.
I felt a little sorry for the Snookelfritz vendor, and may have had a sympathy sample of some ice cream so she wasn't totally ignored (I do what I can).
Parking is a hassle.
It really makes you feel like you're part of a community! went to the green city market for the first time this weekend & was very impressed with the large selection of fresh produce!!! it was a bit crowded though (definitely try coming early/also parking is limited), but we managed to browse through pretty much everything. there are so many fresh vegetables to choose from, & the vegetables are so vibrant in color!
The filling was a lamb and veggie egg scramble.The prices are a bit too lofty for this to be a regular thing, but it's definitely a nice treat on a gorgeous day.
The Green City Market is one of those brilliant places where community, culture and food meet to create something quite special.
Every farm, from Seedling to Heritage Prairie, shows the utmost care for their product and their customers.
It's been a drain on the quality of other city neighborhood markets.
I took my grandma who is from a small town of 19,000 people.
Lots and lots of vendors, lots and lots of choices.
And we sampled lots of cheese and pickled mushrooms.
And I go to the small one on Wednesday!!
That's Rick Bayless".She had no right, but she took away some of my cool points nonetheless.
For a $5 purchase, you get parking in the lot at the Chicago History Museum for $9.
It's a great community.I encourage everyone to become a member - such a worthy, wonderful cause.
I cannot wait one day to bring my family here and have the kids enjoy it too!
Overall, a fun farmers market with lots of fresh and exotic food to offer.
The prepared foods are great.
Very lovely farmers' market - the location is awesome, the products are great, and the vendors offer lots of samples and information about their wares.
I had cash.
Seeing as many smiles and content faces as I did.
Cash my friend, cash would be king here.
This little crosswire between Lincoln Park and Old Town is RIPE FOR THE (yuppie) pickin', but they let everyone in...even dogs! and babies!
Fight the crowds for that produce, peeps!3.
PRICES: higher than your local bodega, but lower than Jewel.
There are some downsides to this particular setting though: **No parking--it is located in Lincoln Park not far from the dairy farm section of the zoo **CROWDED!!! does not mattered if you go Wed or Sat--this place gets packed. **STROLLERS--I cannot even begin to tell you how many times I got knocked in the legs by people pushing strollers--honestly people--LOOK!! **Layout--they pack a ton of stuff into the area and it can be hard to get to certain booths because of that.
No way! (Side note, I didnt get to try them as they were still setting up, damn).Stuff is super expensive, which is to be expected for that quality and that neighborhood, but you can get discounted parking in the very convenient Stockton Drive lot for $4.
Small, but well worth it.
The weather was not so great and threatening storms and STILL it was PACKED.
Had to walk around for a bit to find a pole to lock up my bike and the place was just crawling with children and strollers and young parents.
Definitely not for those with little patience for children as I was ran over by strollers at booths and pushed through by small children clamoring for samples.
Some booths are friendly than others and some are just not (ehem...Hoosier Mama Bakery.)
The produce was super fresh and I thought, very reasonably priced.
The meat was also an excellent value with both the lamb brats and a pound of bacon at a much lower price than a grocery store.
There were too many big dogs walking around.
One thing to keep in mind though, take public transportation, parking is tough.
And you really can't put a price tag on knowing that you're not feeding yourself and your family nasty chemicals and pesticides.
SUV strollers were causing pedestrian traffic jams and dogs were barking everywhere and getting in fights.
I liked seeing people being recognized by vendors and saying hello.
More than shopping however, this market is really fun.
The people-watching is great, celebrity chef spottings are common and occasionally the professional athletes that live in Lincoln Park will saunter over with their families.
Watch the chef demo or listen to some folk music.
I always come home with a very large bag of fruits and veggies.. and an empty wallet.Most of the vendors are super friendly and are willing to answer my dumb questions about how to cook certain veggies..
Now that I have a shorty, I need to find places that are family friendly and interesting for my baby.
First of all, it's fairly small.
The ones located in the loop and Dearborn/Divison (if it's still there) are much bigger and offer a lot more.While I enjoyed the various samples, I didn't find much to be outstanding.
Parking is scarce because the farmers park their large trucks and vans on Clark Street and therefore take up a considerable amount of spots.
Go early (like 7AM) for best parking, picks and to avoid the crowds.
After fighting for parking we had to step over so many strollers and dogs that we were more frustrated with our experience there.
People often bring their strollers and doggies.
Bring cash.
I love supporting local business and farmers, and this place is great.
I thought that the whole thing was quite small.
The produce is always top-notch, even if it is a little expensive.
The Green City Market is great.
It also helps support local, family-run farms, of which this great nation has all but killed off.
It can be overly crowded, somewhat expensive, and I have to take the Lincoln bus, which is not my favorite CTA bus line by any means.
None of these, however, are that big of a deal.
Like most of the rest of the world.As for a few of the complaints that I have seen, such as price, selection, and parking...
Green City Committee members should listen to customers wants and needs instead of playing High horse and thinking they are always right....
Also, it is a great thing to support local, independent farmers and to have the opportunity to actually talk to the people planting, growing and harvesting the food you eat.
All the vendors are friendly and you can see the wheat grass guy trying to get people to buy his shots of health. 5 stars, even with wheat grass guy.
You gotta get there early if you wish to avoid the crowds.
All of the vendors were so friendly and attentive and it was just a really great experience overall.
Also great for horse watching.
People make entire mornings out of this by bringing children/pets and enjoying the free (sometimes good) music and the chef demonstrations.
Love the food demos, and lots of great vendors.
Tried the burger stand - great meat, though they put a little too much stuff on it for me.
Those that were there were incredibly friendly and had such amazing products.
You can pick up alot of your favorite gourmet items in small portions, and alot of the farmers and vendors let you taste before you buy.
The peaches were COMPLETELY moldy 36 hours later, even though I stored them as directed.
Downside -- it's expensive and hard to park near.
Need I say more?New to this market, rode my bike from the near south side and will not go back, Wish I has something good to say.It just brought back how exclusive and high priced fixed "Organic and Local" have become for no good reason but to drive everyday pople away.
Just because it is a LOCAL farmer dosen't mean they won't charge 3x the price.
Very pricey, but I went along with it because I like supporting local producers.
I stopped because I got tired of fighting my way through throngs of strollers, large dogs, bicycles, and people stopping to socialize.
It is not a dog run.
Bring a friend to entertain your dog while you shop.
Have someone take your kids to Lincoln Park while you shop.
And move out of the market when you feel the need to cluster together in large groups to socialize.
It's a strange and wonderful mix of Midwestern charms.Saturdays feature live music and chef demonstrations, and dogs and children scamper underfoot.
Seriously people do you need to bring your double wide strollers, dogs, carts, bikes....!!!Then stroll around the walking path like it is for your own personal use.Please get some manners and respect other people who are simply trying to walk.I hate complaining but also when there is a free sample please do not push people aside to get your piggy hands on a piece of cheese.I don't think the purpose of going to a market is to leave with anxiety Undoubtedly one of the city's best farmer's markets, boasting a wide array of products sold by friendly vendors in a luscious atmosphere.
Some things are a little pricey but so worth it.
It's definitely the best place to get some tasty local produce at reasonable prices.
Oh, this is the place where I discovered goat cheese (where have you been all my life?) on toast with I think it was peach preserves.
Great market but VERY expensive.
Bring lots of cash and don't expect to get much for it.
SUPER expensive and many items are cheaper at Whole Foods.
I know the idea is to support local farmers but sometimes it's just too expensive to do that.
This market is great, especially when it is only blocks from my apartment!
It does get crowded and no one wants to be in a rush enough that they start throwing elbows to get through the crowd.
Love the ambiance, the music, and more.
Not all stands are created equal...some of the staff is friendlier than others.
I try to stick to the friendly ones.
Prices are high, but no more so than Whole Foods, and with the cost of farming and getting into the city constantly growing the prices are fair.
Green City Market is great.
That's great.
The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is that it is really pretty expensive.
If you are worried about prices - then you aren't here for the right reasons. if you want to see green garlic, young ginger, amazing IN-SEASON organically grown fruits/veggies, cheeses, meats, and baked goods - then stay, cause this place is right where you belong.
Perhaps of even greater note the people who run the booths are incredibly friendly and willing to help you and answer questions.
Parking is problematic to say the least.
I must have turned into the wrong parking lot because I ended up paying $9 AFTER validation, which upset me greatly.
Be aware of this and either go super early to take advantage of free street parking in the adjoining streets or be ready to stomach kinda outrageous parking costs.
Always plenty of samples to go around.
If you prefer a smaller crowd you can go on Wednesday instead of the packed Saturday.
I am a BIG fan of samples for tasting, and this place delivers.
Prices are not as cheap as stanley's, but cheaper than most places for equal quality and selection.
Expecting a bigger crowd on Saturday, I was actually able to walk through with my two dogs with no problems at all.
Prices also vary, so make sure to browse the entire thing before buying.
Maybe the reason the rest of the market wasn't so crowded, is because everyone was congregated in this one area.
This was such a cute market.
I really liked the stands that had samples like the cheese stand, the salsa and jam place, and the cracker place.
I would have liked it sweetened a little bit and a little more strawberry-flavored.
But then again, this Green City Market is all organic and is not as big.
The fruit, although a little more expensive than Jewel is good.
I can easily spend over an hour here looking at the different booths and sampling cheeses.
I also found some good honey there in a glass cute bear.
I went here with Chef Mindy Segal, and it was so nice to meet the local farmers in the area.
Go around 10:30 and catch some great live music.Great place to meet other moms, let baby hear the sounds of live music, get some produce...overall, just a fabulous outing for mom and baby!***5 Strollers*** Last year, there were signs posted that "No Dogs" were allowed in the market.
People were pretty good about honoriing them.
This year, there are no signs and there are dogs of all sizes and shapes, in someone's control and not in anyone's control, all over the market.
I though that the Board of Health required no dogs where food was being served.
The location is great and it's in such a beautiful area and right next to the gorgeous Lincoln Park.
Go hungry cuz there's lots to nibble and sample on!
The farmers & vendors are friendly, knowledgeable about their wares & quite helpful in what you can do with their products.
If you have the need to talk to someone at the Green City staff table you'll find another grouping of friendly faces that are so happy to be there doing their job.
The people were super nice and the air was filled with the amazing aromas of fresh fruits, veggies and herbs.
Prices are a bit high but you are paying for organic and supporting local farmers.
I only deducted one star because of the prices.
I SWEAR they raise them a buck when they set up in Lincoln Park, because of the affluent neighborhood.
Dogs are very welcome, and is a great place to meet and pet dogs! (I love that.)
There is a bike rack, and parking is available for a fee at North Ave. and LaSalle.
Hope it gets bigger, there weren't that many vendors, but we did show up a little late.
Bought five different kinds of cheeses--very pleased with the exceptional but a bit expensive Little Darling cheese.
It is a little pricey, but it is all local and organic so you have to take that into consideration.
Because of this there is little competition among the vendors and the prices are quite high.
Also, being in the heart of lincoln park parking is quite difficult to find, there are meters which are almost always reserved for the vendors.
There is a parking lot but you end up paying about $9 for parking.
I would love to see a bigger market featuring more vendors and lower prices that would offer lower income families a good outlet for fresh produce.
