It's also free to enter which is awesome, because some of the others are $20 ahead.The store sells fresh vegetables, apples, and everything you would expect from a place like this.
So we had to stop, fresh apples and raw local honey all great.
The store also had fresh squash, veggies and even canned goods.
Once we got back we made our way to the shop where we bought freshly dried corn on the cob to take home and pop fresh popcorn on our own!
