I saw other reviews saying things were expensive but they weren't at all.
It was really small, and really expensive!There were a few vendors that had a wide array of produce, but the prices were just astronomical...
I couldn't see myself shelling out between $4-6 per pound for tomatoes that I could go over to Mariano's and get, just as local, for half the price.
No thanks.We did a walk through and neither of us decided to purchase anything, due to the high prices.
