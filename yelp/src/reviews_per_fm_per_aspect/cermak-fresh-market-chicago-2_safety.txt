The meat and seafood area was really well stock and clean.
This is a pretty cool option for local groceries -a bit, organized and clean store.
Maybe I'm not seeing what others see, but I went to Cermak today for the first time and saw a clean, bright, beautiful grocery store.
I saw a lot of employees stocking/cleaning and they seemed available for questions if needed.
They may not cater to the upscale, organic crowd, but that's fine by me.The store was bright, clean, and well kept.
It is always clean and well-stocked.
Clean and alright.
