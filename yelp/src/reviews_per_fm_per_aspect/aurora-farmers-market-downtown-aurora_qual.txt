I have went to this food market several times and I enjoyed the fresh produce.
The food is fresh and the prices are good.
When I go I usually spend about $30 and I walk out with a decent amount of fresh produce.
We got some Michigan peaches that were to die for and the best broccoli ive ever had.
Some things are pricey, but pretty comparable with organic produce at the grocery store.
Where oh where will I buy the most perfect grape tomatoes when I can't get them from Josie's booth?How will I survive without the fresh pulled red onions of joy?What about Dad's Roadhouse salsas and sauces?The sweet cakes and breads?The hot sauce?!The fresh tamales made at the Chinese food booth? (I'm serious, they rock!)Most importantly, where in the suburbs am I going to find the freshest and best cheese around, if I can't stop to see Rick at the cheese booth courtesy of The Cheese People of Beloit?
Do I really gotta drive to Wisconsin? *Sad face* I can't choose the cheese that I'll miss the most, but I will list a few of my favorites:Fresh Cheese Curds (Tuscan blend were phenom)Smoked String Cheese (tastes like camping!)Goat Gouda (Gouda is good-ah!)Sweet Cream Pistachio Log (*drool*)Amish Baby Swiss (Oh, gawd I think I'm going to cry)I will impatiently await your return while biting my nails in anticipation.
Dick's Donuts sells mini donuts made fresh on the spot.
