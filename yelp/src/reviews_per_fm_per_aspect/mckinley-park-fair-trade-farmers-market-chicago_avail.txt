I really enjoyed chatting a little with some of the vendors: Pixie Dust Salts - sea salt mixtures like vanilla, lavendar, rosemary ; John Bailey Honey (Keisha is a delightful young lady that introduced me to the products) - not only honey, various fruit jams, applesauce ; two produce vendors : Steve Frank Farms and Cedillo's Fresh Produce.
