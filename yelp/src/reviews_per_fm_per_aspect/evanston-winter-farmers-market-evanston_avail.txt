Keep in mind that as this is a winter market the selection is a little more limited, but you can definitely get your fill of awesome products all the time.
I believe there was one vendor with apples and pears, one with potatoes and such, and of course River Valley with their ubiquitous mushrooms.
Otherwise, this is really a crafts and specialty foods market: perhaps about a dozen vendors hawking all sorts of artisanal snacks such as jerky, salsa, gluten-free cookies, granola, and quickbreads (Treasure Breads--delicious).
