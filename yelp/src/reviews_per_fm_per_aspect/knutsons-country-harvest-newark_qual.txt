Their preserves, produce and honey are wonderful and well priced.
Called ahead and they said there was a good selection....especially the red delicious.
They kept offering their Acadia berries (very healthy but not tasty) and pointing out the tomatoes (I have my own).What's really sad is while we were trying to find berries, at least 5 more families showed up.
I bought a "fresh baked cinnamon roll" that was dry and frozen in the middle.
We bought peaches ($2.50 a pound, pricey) and hoped they were good because there weren't any available to taste.
I tried the blueberry jam and it was tasty, but we didn't buy any.
Much better prices and quality.
It was so delicious that I had her bring me a 5lb. tub, and after that another.
This is exactly what I look for in honey, other than being local, tasty, and the tendency to become solid at cooler temperatures, indicating that it's raw.
I thought what a great activity, the children get to see how apples grow, take them home make applesauce together.
When I got home, I opened the bag and to my shock and dismay, the apples looked NOTHING like those in the store, in fact they looked like the throwaways!
There were 15 apples in the bag and 13 of the 15 were rotten with black holes and bruises with rotten spots.
