Old lady in the store can use a lesson in customer service.
There was on other customer behind us.
As we are walking up there was one other customer behind us.
". It was in a very rude tone that she couldn't wait to get out all while she ignored the customers at her register.
If it was that big of an issue she could have addressed it when she first noticed it quietly not in front of other customers.
It's too bad this employee that needs a lesson in customer service has reunited my family's perception of all Edwards Apple Orchard locations and brands.
Great family outing with many things to do for the kids.
The orchard is small.
Also, not worth the price.
Smaller version of Poplar Grove but much less busy.
They also have corn kernel sensory areas and a cool little school house and tractors to sit on.
Great donuts as usually and cute gift shop.
Only bad thing that happened was one of their dogs ate my sons donut out of his hands This family Fall day trip never disapoints.
Even my college aged girls love the day out and there are always lots of young families running around enjoying themselves.
