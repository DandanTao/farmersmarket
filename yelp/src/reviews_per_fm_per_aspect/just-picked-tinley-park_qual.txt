From fresh picked (hence the name) corn, to some of the best looking tomatoes I've seen in a while.
Watermelon, green onions which also appear to be fresh picked, locally produced honey and some of the best apples I've ever tasted.
Check this place out and find out how good food REALLY tastes when it's truly fresh.
I'm writing this as I eat the peaches and cherries from the market and they are absolutely delicious and fresh.
Quality you can taste.
I still have to get something that is not fresh from this place the corn cantaloupe among others are exceptionally SWEET I can't believe this local gem hasn't been reviewed yet.
The bi-color sweet corn is amazing.
Also, for grilling fans, the corn they grow is ideal for whole cob grilling.
When done soaking pull off any fine hairs or dangling husk to prevent a fire, put on the grill, rotate a quarter turn regularly, and in 15 minutes you have maybe the best ear of corn you have ever tried.
