High quality heirloom tomatoes, squash, peaches, and other fruits/veggies.
Not many vendors but it has a great selection of vegetables.
Was hoping for more flower venders, mostly fruits and veggies, a local pie shop and bread company.
I can get all of the things I need to prepare a fabulous, seasonal meal and it's just blocks from my apartment.
Fresh fruit, vegetables, and everything else you'd expect to find at your local farmers market is here.
Not quite as big as the Lincoln Park one but has a great selection of vendors.
It is small enough to be stress free yet there is a variety of fruits and vegetables, baked goods and flowers and I always can find what I want.
