Also one of the rare places to get local, and I mean LOCAL (Orland park) harvested freshly made Honey.
Also great to build up tolerances to seasonal allergies.
There were a lot of people there and some of the fruit and veggies were already put away.
Tom, the farmer extraordinaire, is a great resource for all things produce.
Any locals who haven't been here need to get on it right away.
All of the people who work here are great, and are very helpful.Now the best part.
Small trips, like a half dozen corn and four or five tomatoes never exceed $5.00 ..This place is amazing, the people are great, produce us unreal good, and the price is far less than you can imagine.
This is the ideal place to shop and support local farming.
The people are friendly I love coming to this place, I can get enough of their corn .Yum-yum. yummy!
