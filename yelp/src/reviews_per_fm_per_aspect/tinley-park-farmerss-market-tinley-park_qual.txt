These are the juiciest peaches you will find and remind me of the juicy peaches I had as a kid growing up.
I've been buying my fruit from Mike for about the last seven years and wouldn't even consider going anywhere else.If you haven't tried Twin Garden Farms Mirai corn yet, you don't know what you're missing.Stop by and see Adla for your Tupperware, Gail Hanks for your Pampered Chef items, Tyrone and Denise for the best priced, great quality T-shirts around Just came last weekend.
I was really really excited to ride my bike to this and to be able to buy local produce again.
And the local and sustainable grown FOOD.
Like the lovely people behind the facebook page told me, and since you can no longer read it I will repeat it here:"We DO NOT and WILL NOT be selling local or organic produce.
I saw only two produce stands and one was almost sold out of everything.
