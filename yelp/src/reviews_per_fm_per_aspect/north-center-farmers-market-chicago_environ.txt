The honey is outstanding and decently priced.
There were only about 4-5 stands when I went last weekend and was disappointed by how small it was considering the neighborhood it serves.
Sadly, there was precious little to choose from here and it more felt like a small roadside stand in upper Wisconsin.
Yes, it's small, but it's my neighborhood market and I love it.
Small, perhaps, but marvelous!
Yes it is a SMALL market, but its right here in my back yard and I like that.
One nice addition though is the cheese stand.
