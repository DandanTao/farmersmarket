I had been paying $4 for organic, cage-free eggs from Target, but found out there were 2 places nearby that sold eggs for a similar price.
They are guaranteed cage free...I mean, sure they're fenced in on the 1-2 acre lot, but I'd consider that cage-free.
The eggs are delicious!
Once you start eating fresh eggs, it's really hard to go back to store-bought eggs.
They also sell duck eggs and locally produced honey from Sugar Grove.
Love farm fresh eggs so I was willing to drive out here to get great eggs.
