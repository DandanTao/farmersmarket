Top quality and great selection at very reasonable prices for items not found in the chain big box stores.Having worked in a couple of greenhouses in the 1970's as a teenager, I can appreciate the operation of a family run, independent business that has put in many long hours to make Smits Farms Greenhouses a success.
I loved the many outdoor garden flowers I bought for my home!The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and most accommodating.Great find!Highly recommended!
They are friendly and knowledgeable, and have great produce + plants.
The prices are extremely reasonable.
