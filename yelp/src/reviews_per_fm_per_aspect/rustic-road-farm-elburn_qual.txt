The store always has fresh eggs, some meat and farm vegetables.
Everything was delicious and high quality.
If you think you are getting high end, great quality bacon from your local chain grocery store, you aren't!
If you want high quality food, that is organic and GMO free, this is the place to go.
Came home with fresh eggs (never had a fresh egg before), honey, cocoa honey, garlic, pork loin roast and newly signed up for a 20 weeks csa starting in june.
Fresh, local produce.
Great deal for organic produce.
The farm is great as you can see the chickens, goats, pigs and produce for yourself.
It shows in the quality of their food.
My toddler had a great time chasing chickens and petting baby goats with my husband while I was able to peruse the store.
They sell fresh eggs, gorgeous produce, ciders, grains, pork, chicken - a one stop shop.
