Go support your local vendors and enjoy.
The veggie stand across from the flowers....PERFECT.
I feel some prices are higher than Whole Foods can be sometimes which is hard for me to justify purchasing (A small box of Michigan cherries for $9, and no they're not organic).
Fruits and veggies are obviously seasonal but I feel there is always a great selection.They have a stand to get your knives sharpened and I always mean to head over there since a friend of mine gets her knives done once every summer.
But one thing that I think is worth noting is the prices.
It's a lovely gathering, and if you've got the cash great.
It's l ocated at the Downers Grove Main Street train station, South Parking Lot off Burlington Ave.
There's plenty of street, lot, and garage parking.
This is a really good farmers market.Lots of great vendors and offerings.
Lots of parking.
But, like most farmer's markets, many things are unnecessarily over-priced.
There were food vendors and lots of interesting non-food spots.
I found plenty of easy parking available across the tracks.
Don't support farmers whose livelihood depends on their local neighbors.
A fun way to start the weekend.
Nice selection but a bit pricey.ARRIVE EARLY,later in day its crowded.
Farmer's markets are fun and you do get to sample local vendor's product.
The vegetables are reasonably priced, especially if you shop what is in season.
I realize that this cannot be Green City Market and that I'm out in the 'burbs, but a girl can hope right?The market can get crowded.
Leave your pup at home, dogs are not allowed in the market area.
Really great selection and fair prices.
Plus we should all support our local growers whenever possible.
