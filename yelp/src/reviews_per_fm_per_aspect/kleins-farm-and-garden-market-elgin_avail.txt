Also, they have a variety of fruits and vegetables not available in most stores, like kalirabi.
They have a ton of variety in terms of both type and color.
Klein's has a wonderful variety of very healthy plants and flowers.
In addition to a great selection of healthy plants, they also sell great sausage, cheese curds, relishes, fresh local grown vegetables and fruit!
While the selection was not overwhelming, everything was incredibly fresh.
We came last year for flowers and now this year for tomato plants for the garden as well as flowers for our flower bed.
The jar of pickled Brussels sprouts I found was a tasty treat; I only wish they were locally produced.
