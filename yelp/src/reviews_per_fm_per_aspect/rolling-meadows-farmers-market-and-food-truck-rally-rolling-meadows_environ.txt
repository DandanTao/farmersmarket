This has the makings for something great.
It's a nice space and there's plenty of street parking.
It's FREE and they even gave me a small reusable shopping tote.
As I said it has the makings for something great because there really weren't that many vendors there.
And the prices were high, even for organic prices.
The nice thing was they had a quite a few high long tables that you could stand and eat at.
One a month from June through October from 10am to 2pm, Rolling Meadows City Hall puts on this small, but eclectic and fun little Farmer's Market & Food Truck Rally in their parking lot.
It's put on by the city and it's not this big-budget production, but they do a really nice job at this totally free-to-attend gathering.
Very family friendly and with a nice variation of vendors, though they could use a few more savory food options as it was a bit heavy on the sweets, making the one, single savory truck at last Saturday's event a very hot (re: 30+ minute line for tacos... that were reportedly excellent) commodity.
As with any multi-vendor event, each business brought something a little different and special and prices varied.
There was also this cool police tank type vehicle for kids to check out, and at one point they turned the lights on and it was neat for kids to see.
This event is not a "farmers market" there is one tent with produce at prices higher than whole foods!There were maybe 5 vendors I'd interact with like discounted Pampered Chef, Tupperware, and shoulder massages.
