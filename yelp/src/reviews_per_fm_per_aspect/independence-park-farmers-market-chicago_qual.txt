Lots of organic produce to choose from, a local grass-fed beef farm that also offers organic chicken and great pork and lamb products, a Wisconsin organic farm offering a variety of salsas and jam, and homemade soaps!
The Plapp Family organic flours and frozen meats are a standout.
Fruit tarts (sold by a nun in an actual habit?!) are delicious; organic salsa is another favorite.
At our last visit we had our knives sharpened, picked up some yummy sunflower/rye bread, delicious berries, bok choy, ramps, broccoli and asparagus from a sustainable farmer.
