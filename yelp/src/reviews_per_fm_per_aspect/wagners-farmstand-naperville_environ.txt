Prices were VERY reasonable.
They are really nice people, and they even take credit cards (which is great).Overall an excellent farmstand!
Really cute little farmstand/nursery.
I am not sure why this was a requirement and I hope in the future they will rethink this as it deters probably many more customers.
There are quite a few farm stands in the area.
Staff was too busy flirting with customers to take a question, and when finally talking to a manager they were condescending and abrupt.
Fresh local produce and friendly, helpful service.
I enjoy going to this small friendly farm stand every week from July all the way thru October!
