And everything looked very fresh.
In addition, there is a nut butter station where you can either take one of the containers they already made (prices were listed on the lid or taped on the bottom), or you can grind fresh on your own.
The selling point of the store is the personal care section.
They carry all the brands of vegan/natural/cruelty free skincare and hair care that I have been curious about and I love the fact that they have 'try me' products, so you can see if you like the smell, consistency, etc before you buy.
Fresh produce.
They have pretty decent ready-mades, meats, and fresh veggie sections.
This place is great has the best customer service ever great produced and a fresh selection of meat products.
Very bad the way this was handle!I ask for the manager guess what no he not in!You got to be kidding!!!I told them why you selling chicken that smells bad people can get sick.They just look at me.

Four words that will change your life: gluten free apple pie.Right when you walk in, there is a huge frozen gluten free section with delicious treats.This place is awesome, but especially for those who are gluten free like me!#glutenfreegoodness #heaven #applepie Love the new Fresh Thyme.
First experience at Fresh Thyme and I am very pleased with my produce.
The worst thing was the cashier packed our food in the bag with soap.
The produce was good and the prices are very competitive.
Fresh Thyme has the best salad bar in town, hands-down!
The organic produce is awesome.
It carries brands and a store brand committed to better ingredients.
I don't go through eggs that fast and even though people will argue that eggs are still good after the "best by" date, I like to consume before that date, and usually have no problem getting fresher eggs anywhere else in the area.
The turnover in this store just isn't good enough for me to come back, not to mention that horrible smell and insects on the fresh bread.
