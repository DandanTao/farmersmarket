The market is held every other Sunday morning, and it features a variety of vendors and farmers and craft people from NW Illinois and Iowa locales.
There is a great variety of locally grown produce, and I would say you could get just about everything you might need or want.
Vegetables like Kolrabi, fennel bulbs, parsnips and rutabagas.
There are also baked goods, homemade sausages and other meat products, flowers and lots of pickled things.
The "Aunt Beez" booth was my favorite for freshness, variety, and vegetables and flowers with that Disney quality about them.
