Walking past all the beautiful berries and veggies, because I can find those in Bay Area easily.
I asked for a couple little samples and was sold.
And added an excellent flavor to a spinach casserole later!
And at 6$ a bag I couldn't say no.They have excellent string cheese for the real connoisseur as well, all in a fun community market setting.
The guys behind the table are great, and I look forward to future munchies!
