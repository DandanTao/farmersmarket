Awesome veggies plants too.
The sweet corn is always amazing and the candy apple red onions.
Much of the produce is grown right there and the rest is local.Today was onions, leeks, tomatoes and peppers.
Corn is over for the season, but the place is stocked with pumpkins, squash and gourds.
I called the winter before so the farmer could plant additional white pumpkins and discussed the exact number I needed.
They do herbs and other plants and flowers early in the season, and fruits and veggies (mostly veggies) for the rest of it.Quality and prices are good.
