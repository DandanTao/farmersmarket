They had a breakfast buffet provide by Egg Harbor and as may be expected for anything from EH, the quality was very fresh and good for their pancakes, scrambled eggs, sausage, coffee, and OJ.
This place is awesome to take the kids I was very impressed and the best part is that it's FREE....
Good looking veges and produce.
Best produce around.
I've seen more than a few items with grocery store-type PLU labels on the produce and I'm sure they don't grow those labels naturally.
I like to try out the baked goods from Zingarella, High Rise, and Foodstuffs.
