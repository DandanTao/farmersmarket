I wouldn't expect anything less from the Pumpkin Capital of the World!Ackerman Farms is a top notch local family (pumpkin) farm.
They have a wide range of "fancy" pumpkins (various colors and shapes), blue ribbon pumpkins, and a plethora of pumpkins and gourds in all sizes!
Far better variety and quality of pumpkins than Walmart.
