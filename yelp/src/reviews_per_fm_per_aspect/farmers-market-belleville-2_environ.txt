Awesome and extremely courteous staff.
The customer service here is great!
Great place for fresh and inexpensive fruits and veggies.
Additionally they have local products, like honey which is great for allergies.
On top of all that, they're great with kids, they have a spin the banana which everyone is a winner and they get a free apple, banana or orange!
They have the market crate too, but my family is too picky to eat all the veggies it comes with, but for $20 it's a great deal.
What a great place to get fruit and vegetables.
A friendly staff.
They even make it fun for the kids, have them ask to "Spin the banana".
Love this place...they always are friendly and treat you well.
You get 16-18 pieces of fruit (or veggie chips which freaking rock!) delivered to your place of employ for $9.99.Right now, your business has to be signed up for delivery, but a lot of major St. Louis businesses are.
Great local farmer's market!!
Great atmosphere, great service!
