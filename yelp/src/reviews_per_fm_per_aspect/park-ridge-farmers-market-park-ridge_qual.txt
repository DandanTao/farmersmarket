Prices are expectedly high, but quality is tremendous across the board.
KILLER kettle corn from a dude named (I mean, nick-named, presumably) Kernel Dan.
Great vendors, quality produce, fair pricing.
I left with some apricot-nut brie cheese ($7), and a huge bunch of fresh eucalyptus ($5).
Only one organic vendor.
The PRFM has what may be the best corn I've ever tasted.
I guess I've just been buying them from the wrong place.Another perk: many of the people working here can answer questions about the produce and other products.
Plus, most of it is organic, and I am comparing the prices to the non-organic produce at Jewel or Dominick's.
While you can't pick the particular color of bulb you're getting from his collection, you know it will look awesome when it blooms.His hybrid dayliles can also be seen growing around Uptown Park Ridge, local PR fire stations and many people's backyards all over town.
How fresh were they?
If we buy it, we're gonna buy it here.We (okay, it was me) bought some double chocolate chip cookies from Baked by Betsy; I have to agree with Mike O., in that it didn't taste as great as I'd hoped.
