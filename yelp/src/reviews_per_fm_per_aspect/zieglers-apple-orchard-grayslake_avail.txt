The trees were packed with apples, and we were more than happy with the selection and quality of the apples.
The apple varieties were not well labeled, but we were encouraged to try the apples and determine what we liked!
However, there weren't a lot of varieties of apples.
Banana apples were the favorite of our group, all the varieties were abundant and so perfect.
It would seem not much has changed since Julie H.'s review in 2007: there are still plenty of Golden Delicious trees that seem to outnumber all other varieties.
I guess that I expected an APPLE ORCHARD to have at least as many varieties of apples as a supermarket.
It is quiet, peaceful, and they have TONS of trees and varieties to pick from.
Also, you can sign up for their postcards which they mail out in August with all of their picking dates, times, and varieties that are available.
I was most disappointed by the overall selection: for late September, there were hardly any apples left.
How about variety?
And there's a nice selection of jams/preserves, along with pumpkins, squash, and gourds.
