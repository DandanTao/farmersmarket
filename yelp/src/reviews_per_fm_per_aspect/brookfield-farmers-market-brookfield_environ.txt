There are also quirky events each week and live, low-key music.
Dog friendly!
It's one of the smallest farmers markets I've been to.
The prices are decent.
They've got a lot going on for a small town.
Fun, fresh, and tasty.Cheers!
Eggs, cheeses, honey, baked goods, hand made soaps, flowers, live music and of course wonderful fruits and vegetables, the Brookfield Farmers Market packs a ton into it's small and manageable space.
They do have a band play usually which is great.
Vendors are friendly, willing to tell you about their goods, ingredients, etc.
Picnic tables in the shade, dog friendly, engaging and educational.Updated 5/13/15 as my previous review showed up in the "not recommended" area as the stars were missing...let me clarify...this is STILL my favorite Farmer's Market.
Good prices.
It is a small gig, run by a couple of guys ONLY at the farmer's market.
It's nice to have a Saturday-morning farmers market right around the block from my house - this year, there are fruit and vegetable vendors from Illinois and Michigan farms, a few bakeries, and live music.
(There's also regular representation by local community organizations like the Chamber of Commerce, library board, and garden club.)
