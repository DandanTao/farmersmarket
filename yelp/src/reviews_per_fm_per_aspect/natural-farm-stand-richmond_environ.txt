Located in northeast McHenry County, Natural Farm Stand is a family farm that's been chemical-free for over half a century.
I also saw customers carrying away tens of lbs. of tomatoes, the farm's signature product, priced no more than $1.00/lb, even heirlooms.
They are folks who deeply appreciate needs of both customers and land.
Pick your veggies, weigh them if necessary, calculate your purchase, deposit cash in box.
