The prices were fantastic.
Boggios was a great value!
Great little orchard!
Workers are very friendly.
Lots of animals for the kids to feed.
People are very nice, friendly and helpful.
The corn maze is fun and there's a huge playground for kids.
The prices are really reasonable for an orchard type place.
Each of our big pumpkins was $6 - and they all had prices written on the tops (no weighing by the pound).
Be a great place to pick up some holiday gifts!
Boggios is super fun - just wish the weather hadn't been so cold when we went!
