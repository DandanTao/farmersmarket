It is pouring rain today and the vendors still are friendly with a positive attitude despite the weather.
Granted, the actual shop is technically still on the way to my office, but the market allows me to take a more direct path literally making a donut a stop I can make on the way to work.The stand is fairly small and does not offer nearly as many options as the storefront.
The friendly workers told me they've have a fresh batch in 10 minutes.
Smallish in comparison to other markets, but everyone we came in contact with was extremely friendly and the produce looked great.
This is a small but fun farmer's market that I am planning to go to every week this summer!
Its a nice walk, and you can find some reasonably priced, and delicious items.
It's also nice that it's not all smooshed into a small space.
Its so much cheaper then the neighborhood markets, and its just such a nice visual site on this corner.
Not to mention--the prices were comparable to the store if not cheaper anyway.I plan to go the rest of the summer!
Vendors are extremely friendly and don't seem to mind answering a billion questions about their products.
As the summer progresses and more crops mature, it gets better and better.There are your typical vegetable stands at this market and the prices are always pretty competitive - especially seeing what the energy crisis has done to the price of groceries these days.
There's one stand that sells all herbs at very reasonable prices.
Can't wait to scoop up some morels May 13 - they are worth every penny of their $44/lb. price!
