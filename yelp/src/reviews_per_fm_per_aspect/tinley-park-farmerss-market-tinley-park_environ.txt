Parking was plentiful.
The guy from Churchill Orchards was so friendly and helpful.
Great vendors, great atmosphere, great produce.
But vendors who actually grow the food on their land.
And furthermore, the people who run this operation are not nice people!
I heard great things about the Tinley Park Farmers Market.
It is conveniently located in the Metra parking lot on Oak Park avenue, so it is easy to find and there was lots of parking on the side street.
