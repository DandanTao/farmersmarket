Their apples are delicious and it's not expensive.
They are so soft and delicious and not very sweet.
Apples were good but we had to pick them in about 15 minutes because we were being eaten alive!
The apples were delicious, friendly owner, and we all genuinely enjoyed our time.
The apples were so tasty and juicy.
The donuts for sale were fresh.
Not a circus like most Orchards When my wife (then girlfriend) and I met, we started a tradition of picking fresh apples in the fall so that she can bake delicious homemade pies.
We sampled our loot while walking around which was cool.After we got our fill of apples, we got 2 pumpkins and bought a bunch of stuff in the shop including salsas, apple butter, cider, doughnuts, a bunch of other jars of stuff that looked tasty.
The apples are delicious!
