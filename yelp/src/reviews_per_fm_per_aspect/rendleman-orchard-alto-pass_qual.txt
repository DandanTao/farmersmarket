Their fresh produce is absolutely delicious and their staff are helpful and very friendly.
Their Limited Edition flavored honey butters have impressed many of my guests, and their sugar free apple butter syrup was also a big hit at my house.
They're refreshing and super delicious.
They have a really good apple flavor, and they definitely symbolize the coming of fall.I do think a lot of the stuff here (not including the actual fresh fruit) is overpriced.
Everything looks and sounds delicious though, so it would probably be worth it.
Haven't tried the apple butter but the cider and donuts are delicious!
