There's also a cheese monger and one or two bakery stands, plus Amazing Kale Burger, which, if you haven't tried it yet, is hearty and delicious!
Buying local doesn't get any better.
If you're like me and go to farmer's markets to buy fresh, seasonal produce directly from the growers, look elsewhere.
