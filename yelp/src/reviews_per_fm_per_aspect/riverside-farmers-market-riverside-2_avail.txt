With many vendors offering multiple types of veggies and plants there is a lot to look at.
Got a strawberry rhubarb pie from Yoder bakery, mostly gel with a bit of fruit in it, not whatI expected at all....Items a bit pricy...
Selection of fresh veggies and fruit, plants and flowers, fish & meat, gluten free baked goods, eggs, tasty pastries and breads, pickles and jams, pizza, fresh fruit smoothies, artisanal honey, locally made pottery, dips & salsas, and beeswax candles!
We also came home with gluten free pizzas cooked right there in a wood-fired oven, raw honey from a local beekeeper, a beeswax candle, a gluten free poppyseed loaf, gluten free chocolate chip cookies, and fresh fruit smoothies.
I've been able to purchase almost all my fresh produce this summer at this market.
I liked his tomatoes so much that I purchased a whole box and canned pasta sauce to keep this taste going through winter.
There is enough variety to spend the evening and feed your family dinner at the market with pizza, fruit smoothies, and plenty of baked goods and hand crafted chocolates.
