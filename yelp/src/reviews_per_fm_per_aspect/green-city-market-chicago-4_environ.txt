This market is very small.
A great location that meets an empty spot in the West Loop.
It's great for big groups.
Our party of 18 was well accommodated and everyone had a great meal.
I'm so glad the family with kids left 30 min prior to that scene.
This market is great.
There is parking for a fee and the Halsted bus stops right on the corner of Fulton & Halsted.
It's a neighborhood market that's big enough for the West Loop.
