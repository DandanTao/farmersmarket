Very cute, small market.
As always with farmers markets...parking gets crowded, and prices are above prices of grocery stores.
But what a wonderful location, right in Paulus Park!
I gave the requisite dirty glare as I passed by- how will they learn if I don't? ;) And naturally it was a cute little family, adorable girl in back.
The market is right next to a nice little park with ample parking.
Their summer hours are Fridays 3-7, and bear in mind some places are cash and check only, while others do accept credit cards.
Some others were new to me like Meyer Farm who had nice looking and inexpensive offerings, and to boot, they were extremely nice folks.
I mean, it's not very big, which I kinda like, and it's a lovely park location with interesting products and produce.
