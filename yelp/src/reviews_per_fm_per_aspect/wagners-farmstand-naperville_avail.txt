They also have a really beautiful selection of pastas and honey.
There were all sorts of homemade items in jars.
Jams and jellies.
Awesome people and great variety of local (when possible) fruits and veggies.
Beyond carrying a variety of fruits and veggies -- potatoes, onions, pattypan squash, eggplant, zuchinni, green onion, radishes, apples, peaches, plums, blueberries, among other things -- they also have a number of jams and jellies, sauces, salsas, pickles, and pie fillings ready-made for sale.
There is also a small selection of potted plants outside for sale.
The bigger selection of plants off to the side are apparently sold only to landscapers.
Arugula, cilantro, basil (italian, lemon, thai), cucumbers, white and red potatoes.
Great variety and lots of other items too such as jellys, popcorn kernel varieties and pickles.
And the nectarines, grapes, tomatoes, potatoes, apples,(including honey crisp) pumpkins, and melons are so tasty!
