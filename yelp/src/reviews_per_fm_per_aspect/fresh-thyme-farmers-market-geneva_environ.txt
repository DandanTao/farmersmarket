Staff was friendly, well trained and very helpful... leaving one with an old school manor of conducting business... reminiscent of an era... one where businesses took pride in customer service, as well as their product.
One staff member, who was a stand out... his name was Vinny... singlehandedly earned my business and loyalty for the foreseeable future... he was knowledgeable, helpful and just went above and beyond, to insure a grand, first impression.
To the entire staff:Great job!
Welcome to the neighborhood.
We found prices on many things high while others, were pretty fair.
Bulk items seemed over priced as did Boar's Head deli meats.
Even though I only gave 2 stars and the employees are very helpful, we wonder if they are relying on the new store/grand opening feel that they can elevate prices on some items.
They have a ton of the brands that we value as a family.
There are hardly ANY places in the area (some in Geneva) that serve fresh juice. 10/10 will recommend to family and friends.
Train your employees properly and teach them the differences between certain items when customers ask them a specific question.
I can't say enough great things about this place.
The young lady who prepares the pizzas was extremely friendly and courteous.
Nice to see young people enthusiastic about their job.
