:) Loved perusing this market full of enticing fruits, vegetables, flowers, baked goods, cheeses, and unique items!
My kids shared a Nutella and banana crepe and I had the ham with cheese and mushrooms.
Nice farmer's market although not as broad variety of vegetables as other markets.
The crepe vendor and coffee purveyor had a lot of attention though.
Those fruit tarts are quite tasty.
One aisle to walk through.Aside from the usual market offerings, there are wonderful artistic vendors selling scarves, tablecloths from France, jewelry, handmade items.
It's right next to the train tracks and is a hodge podge of vendors selling everything from veggies to baked goods to bed sheets.
Vendors including jewelry, clothes, soaps, lotions, dog biscuits, and plants.
In the summer, I am able to do enough shopping here for weekly meals, including fish, cheese, bread, a wonderful variety of vegetables, and fruit.
The French Market is smaller than most farmers' markets, but it has a nice variety of everything we need.
Limited selection of regular produce and didn't see any organic.
