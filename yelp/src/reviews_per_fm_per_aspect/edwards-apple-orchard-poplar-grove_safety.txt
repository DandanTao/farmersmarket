They provide an awesome, cleanly array of samples.
I was pleasantly surprised with how nice, clean, and organized the orchard was.
Free entrance, affordable attractions, clean facilities, and ambiance non commercial.
Very clean and well organized; go during the week if you don't like crowds, but for me that is the best part.
Also, this place is VERY clean!!!
