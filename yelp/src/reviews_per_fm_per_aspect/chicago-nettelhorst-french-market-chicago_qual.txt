The cheese from the cheese vender was absolutely delicious.
The fresh peaches from one of the the produce vendors were fresh and juicy.
You are getting a lot of fresh and tasty goods in an area where a lot of people don't mind spending a little extra.
We went on the last day and the produce was not that great.
Produce is great; cheese is great; bakery is very good.
The produce I love b/c I find it to be more affordable and better quality than the stores.
The pretzel bread is amazing (seems to be lots of agreement on this).
The produce is just picked, fresh and wonderful.
The produce is fresh and delish.Last summer, there was a vendor there selling beautiful Italian photographs.
But nevertheless, the stalls that are present are pretty good.
I bought my weekly quota of vegetables and fruits which were all very fresh.
The peaches were wonderful, they were soft and juicy and worth every cent I spent on them(4$ for a box of abt 6-7 good sized peaches).
They had all I was looking for plus yummy looking pastries, pretty flowers and nice handcrafted jewlery and purses.
I went to this market today, hoping to find organic vegetables and be able to give my money to the local economy instead of big corporate conglomerates like Albertsons or Safeway.
I asked one of the guys about some of the vegetables and how they are grown, and I was surprised to find out that they are grown conventionally (hot house and with pesticides).
If you're buying from farmers markets to support local farmers and get organic fresh produce, this is not the one to go to.
They are slightly more expensive than the chain grocery stores, but it does not seem worth the cost.They do have nice crafts there, that I would consider checking out though, I also personally dont' eat any dairy products, so I can't speak about the quality of those items, but I think your money would be better spent on another place's vegetables.
The fresh basil is priceless; it is so fragrant.
