I got some delicious raspberry jam from JellyKicks, salsa from Hair of the Ferret, and a croissant cup for breakfast from DeEtta's Bakery, as well as some sweet corn.
I like to support local growers but the product has to be fresh.
In my opinion, it also has a nice, laid back atmoshere.Look for some delicious gluten-free granola, tart cider, fresh veggies, spicy hot sauces, and homemade treats for Fido.
The prices are very reasonable for produce this fresh and delicious.
Yes! :)Negative: some of the fresh produce we purchased went bad in 2 days. :(We will be back, though.
Always fresh and tastey.
The produce is very limited, while the weekend that I visited had a bunch of fresh blueberries the actual produce was cut down to snap peas, wax beans and cauliflower.
They used to have an organic vendor with lettuces, washed and ready to go, but now I have to grow my own.
The reason is simple, I'm tired of overpaying for the non-organic products and consider the organic product pricing a blatant rip-off.
I got to the point where I would take my purchases back home, weigh them on a very high quality, accurate scale and discovered that my suspicion was correct; I was being consistently overcharged.
Yes it can be pricey and no it doesn't have 'everything'. However, the offerings are top notch and more than reasonable comparing taste and freshness.
