Wide selection of products too!
The lotion/shampoo/soap selection and all the healthcare items offered were very interesting.
Also all the fresh fruits and vegetables were priced either equal to or lower than the cost of similar items at Jewel.
The items I usually get from Fresh Thyme are prepared foods and seafood from their seafood department.
Prices are higher than my regular grocery store, Caputo's, but I like that they carry certain things I cannot find there- fresh sourdough bread, or certain brands, like Brown Cow, for example.
The deli is small, but the selection is good enough.
I truly love the fresh fruits and vegetables.Staff is great:And all the great selection of gluten free stuff!.
A nice selection of standard, unique, and upscale items all over the store.
Love the selection of healthier and natural food options.
They have a good variety of Ezekiel products, not just the loaves of bread, which is usually hard to find.
Great food selection, but the whole inside literally smells like poop.
Went here a few weeks ago, pretty decent selection and they would get 5 stars if it were not for two things.
Tons of beans, nuts, seeds, tofu, berries, fruit, prepared salads, and veggies.
Fresh baked bread that you slice yourself, lots of vegan and healthy options.
Please don't change a thing except for continued what you do and adding more healthy products and always more vegan options.
There are tons of brands for special diets- a ton of gluten free offerings, and great options for those with allergies to dairy and egg as well.The prepared food area is lovely, and the store is easy to navigate.
Good wine selection and personal care section as well.
At the shelves with fresh baked bread in open sleeves I was shocked to see a cluster of fruit flies (that's what they looked like) hovering around an open loaf.
