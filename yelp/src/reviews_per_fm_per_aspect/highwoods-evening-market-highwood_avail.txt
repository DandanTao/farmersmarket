Plenty of alcohol varieties to be found as well.This could easily become a Wednesday regular night out.
We've been pretty pleased with the variety of food trucks, and have enjoyed a number of different tacos, some crepes, and hotdogs and burgers.
There were restaurants from Highwood selling food, bars from Highwood selling booze (and some food), snack vendors, jewelry vendors, clothing vendors, even pony rides, petting zoo and bounce houses and a band!
There are also things you can buy to take home, like preserves, grass fed beef, baked goods, and candy.
