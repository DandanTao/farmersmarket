Tiny Greens sells their wonderful organic produce through Wal-Mart, and at some area farmers markets, and probably more places I don't know about yet.
All were absolutely amazing, flavorful.
The kind of food you can pig out on and feel really good about afterwards.I try to spend my hard-earned on products from this kind of company.
