The animals are so cute and sweet and come right up to say hello.
And, the owners are super sweet.
There are chickens all over the place, two sweet dogs, and lots of sheep and goats.
They also have u-pick berries at the end of the summer for a great price.
We are lucky to have Rustic Road Farm in our community!
The owners are supper friendly and always willing to answer any questions you have.
Please consider support a great local farm.
Owners are very friendly and car about what they are doing.
They are the nicest people!
A major part of what is grown on this farm is served up at Big Bowl or other spots.
