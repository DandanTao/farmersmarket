During peach season they have yummy fresh peach smoothies.
However, my favorite season to visit is autumn when they have fresh apple cider slushies and homemade apple cider donuts.
In addition to fresh produce you can find salsas, jams, syrups, sauces and specialty treats.
Of course, they have apples and peaches, depending on the season with cut samples out for you to try the different varieties.
They also have cider, available in gallons, half-gallons, or adorable little sippy cups.
They also have apple cider slushies available for $1.99- definitely get one.
They have more flavors than apple cider available, including peach, blackberry, and blueberry.
There's also a wide variety of sauces, dips, syrups, spreads, and candies.
We expected the market/storefront at Rendleman's to have a large selection of items made at the orchard, or at least in the local area.
The shelves were stocked with things like jams, salsas, and pasta sauces, but they appeared to be made at a factory somewhere and labeled with a Rendleman sticker.
We bought some apple butter, cider and cider donuts.
I'm a big fan of Rendleman's and have always gotten delicious fruits and products from here practically year round!
Today I also tried the apple butter and their lemon cheesecake fruit dip.
