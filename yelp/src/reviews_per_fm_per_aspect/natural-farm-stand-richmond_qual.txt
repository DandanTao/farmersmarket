Produce quality and pricing make the trip worthwhile.On a typical weekend, its busiest time, you will probably find the farmer, Gary, coming from the fields with fresh-cut produce to restock the stand, something he does throughout the day to keep pace with demand.
This is the best produce at the best prices!
