Wow, this place is incredible!I spend a lot of time in the area at a little vacation home, and I am so mad that I've been going to the crappy town IGA instead of this place for so long.
Check out the photo I uploaded... you won't believe how much I actually got for the price!
One thing to note: if you're using a credit card, it does have to be for over $15.
