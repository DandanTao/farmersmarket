And they have some items that are hard to find in other stores.
In fact, I bought most of my vegetarian Thanksgiving meal items there.
The stores also sell a large variety of fish and meats, both frozen and fresh, and this includes deli-meats.
In the frozen section, along with the usual pork, beef, chicken, and turkey you can find bison, elk, deer, wild boar, and other varieties not often available in groceries.
The fish selection is more standard, but again they focus on sustainable fish.
They also have lots of bulk nuts, grains, rices, dried fruits, and other items.I should also mention that they have a quite good cheese section.
For what it is worth, we did find a $3 bottle of Cabernet there in a brand I never have seen before, so they may have their own "Two Buck Chuck" selection, or it may just have been a special price on something.
It's small with a limited selection.
Meat is good Be fruit is excellent.
There is a small selection of bulk flavored olive oils and vinegars.
They have the biggest selection of cold brew coffees around.
They have a good variety of craft beer.
