It is a nice place to walk around and see the myriad of vendors.
I do visit this market a few times between May and October.SOME of the craft vendors are mighty proud of their wares as evidenced by their high prices.
I do understand that it is hard to put a price on your time but some of the prices being charged are ridiculous.
It is obviously popular with the locals and people were buying.
The event is held in a city park that is right next to a standing water offshoot of the Illinois canal that was covered in bright green algae.
Thank goodness it was drizzling or the mosquitoes would have been unbearable.
