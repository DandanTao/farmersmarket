Reasonably priced produce (best rainbow chard I've ever seen/eaten from here for only $2 a bunch!), and several local artisan booths as well - cheese, tamales, eggs/meat, honey, jams, BBQ/hot sauces, jewelry, breads, etc.
The market is like none of the others in the city due to its Latin American cultural roots and flavors.They have private, original art for sale (meet the artisans themselves), fresh vegetables, breakfast items, coffee/tea/mate, delicious-looking pastries, dog treats, and my favorite...local honey products.They even have a great looking website (listed above).The Bad News: While it is VERY small (10 tents possibly), they have a great variety of local products.Bring cash! :)The VERY Bad News:You'll have to wait until next year ;(.
We picked up some juicy tomatoes, corn, onions, grape tomatoes, potatoes and garlic.
I also scored some fun peach jam.
We usually get the quiche from Beurrage Bakery, and homemade Chili pepper jam with fresh bread.
The eggs that you buy on Sunday were laid on Thursday or Friday, and there is a rather decent selection of cheeses from grass fed animals as well.
It was a bit smaller than I expected and there wasn't much variety but I still snagged some good items.
This is not a huge market nor particularly cheap, but they have venders selling fresh fruits, jams, and tamales and other stuff alongside tables with used books, DVDs, and key chains.
I also found some very dark honey which made me think of Guiness beer so I had to have some.I hate to admit this but the variety isn't quite there to convert me as a regular.
Every Sunday brings an assortment of arts and crafts, fresh produce, tasty coffees, and flowers to the Pilsen neighborhood.
Get there early for the best produce selection and don't forget your reusable bag!
I bought some honey, cheese, raspberry jam, a variety pack of mushrooms, some green beans and green peppers.
