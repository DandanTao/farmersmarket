I loved being able to have a local shop for amazingly fresh and organic produce.
The old owners were as kind as could be and maintained an immaculate store with the freshest of produce and meat.
The new owners have turned the place into a horrible smelling, overpriced and an unfriendly store.
We came one time looking for some vegetables and fresh bread.
When I looked at the baguettes they carried, I noticed that they were all hard, and continued shopping deciding to get the fresh bread elsewhere.
It smelled so good it was all I could do to not simply start gnawing on it right in the store (Because I'm really classy like that).
They have their own butcher onsite so the meat selection and quality is always top notch.
Bonus points that they generally always have cheap chicken along with excellent pork cuts and fish.
It just happens that the quality here trounces pretty much anything within a mile or two for a massive plus.Cliff Notes: Shutup and take my money!
They make their own salsas, and on the weekends they sell fresh homemade tamales as well.
Their prices might be a tiny bit higher than the regular grocery store, but certainly not by much, especially considering all the organic and high end products they offer.
They always keep an eye on their produce to make sure it's fresh.
Vegetables are very fresh too.
Bought fresh chicken breast for $3.50 a pound.
The meat and the produce was great.
