When he finally took me, I could not stop raving about my grocery haul that cost me $6 (okay I have no control)\n\nThis place is incredible for produce. You just cannot beat the prices here. I will likely keep on going to other stores for processed foods since they only have a small selection, but this store really makes healthy eating affordable. \n\nWill be coming back weekly!!",

I wanted to tell the MANAGER and I found out he was one of them. So, it won't happen to another young lady, I will disclose his name. His name is Joe! \n\nI decided to just leave the store because he made me feel very UNCOMFORTABLE! I don't need to feel like I am being harassed and put in a very UNCOMFORTABLE position to go GROCERY SHOPPING. BECAUSE OF Joe and his unwarranted flirtatious advances toward me, I will NEVER EVER SHOP AT STANLEY'S ON ELSTON FOR MY PRODUCE ANYMORE! He made me feel horrible and unsafe in that store! I hope he is gone because the location is very convenient for me.",

While Stanley's was first impressive when I moved to Chicago, I've been more disappointed with their produce selection each time. While Stanley's can have really great sales (ie: 2 packages of blueberries for $1 or 7 kiwis for $1 or something awesome like that), the freshness and the quality of the item is really lacking. \n\nYou have to be really careful with their packaged fruit, especially when there's a good sale, I almost always see mold patches. I understand wanting to clear off the merchandise but I also don't want to bring home moldy food. When the items aren't on sale, it's often more expensive than places like Jewel. While Stanley's is close and convenient, I find myself shopping here less and less.",

            "description": "I heard about Stanley's through Yelp.\nI decided to check it out yesterday.\nThen store is basically comprised of fruits and vegetables with a sections for deli meat, bread and things such as hummus, milk, tortillas, eggs etc \n\nI loved that they had spring mix salad in a bulk container. I filled a clear plastic bag and it cost me only 1.27.\n\nThe vegetable selection is very good and everything is pretty fresh (except for the cherry tomatos they had on special for 99 cents but that makes sense that they would be on special lol)\n\nI found the fruit selection to be good Pretty standard (nothing crazy like no passionfruit or anything like that) just the basic fruit. One thing I realized is the fruit was actually more expensive than jewel.\n\nI found that the vegetables were cheaper than the average store but the fruit not so much.\n\nMilk, eggs etc sre more expensive than the grocery store.\n\nHummus was super cheap 1.49! And tasty!\n\nBaguette bread was really good and regular price. \n\nTortillas were 3 for 1.49 (49,49 and 51 cents) a bit more than jewels 45 cents or Aldis 3 for 1 dollar ..but they were warm still! Which was like wow!! \n\nThe store is kept clean.\nThe store has a very large parking lot.\nThey do have bags incase you forget your bags.\n\nI'm not 100% sure if I'd go out if my way to come here for fruit. But for potatoes and veggies definitely! \n\nThe reason for my 4 out of 5 star-\nPrices on some items\nCut into 1 or 2 apples I bought and one was brown rotted inside.   I use to work in the fruit industry in Canada as a side job ..some apples can be kept in refrigeration up to 6 months. This is a prime example of an apple that has been kept in a cooler and not fresh even though it looked fresh. It is what it is but it was a waste of my money which was disappointing. And the fact my husband didnt get his apple in his lunch (lol) !!!",

Items are frequently out, hours decreased, things I've purchased for years have been discontinued (hello heavy cream?), and I'm not sure what hole some of the new staff crawled out of.\n\nThey've also recently closed the salad bar.\n\n I've watched a juice bar attendant drop produce on the dirty floor and pick back up and put right into a juicer for someone's drink.\n\nI used to get all my deli meat here also as I love the fact they carry Boar's Head and all natural deli meats and cheeses. Exceptional quality and okay prices.\nBut who wants curly little beard hairs in their deli meat?! For the Love of food safety- WEAR A FREAKING BEARD NET or work a different job. #sogross",

We're recent Chicago transplants and in making runs to and from Crate and Barrel down the street, we've driven by Stanley's probably half a dozen times and have commented every time on how cute the logo is. \n\nToday we finally made it there to do some grocery shopping. The deals certainly can't be beat: We got a box of cherry tomatoes, a huge bag of Brussels sprouts, a massive sweet potato, a cucumber, two red onions, two bottled drinks, 8 plums and a massive chunk of feta all for $20. \n\nIt all looked fresh enough, but upon prepping dinner tonight I realized that half of the Brussels sprouts were moldy, the sweet potato had a brown, rotten core, the tomatoes were shriveled and a quarter of each of the onions was brown. \n\nI guess the deal with Stanley's is that everything is a bargain, but I would expect the fruit and veg to be mostly or even somewhat fresh. (And we used to shop at Whole Foods 365 so we're not averse to buying \"ugly\" produce.) I've never had this experience even when shopping from my crappy corner bodega in New York.",

It seems every time I bring my own bag, the cashiers NEVER bag my items.  Yet when I pay for a 0.7 for a bag, the cashiers bag my items no problem.  If that is the store rule, I wish they would put up a sign. It would avoid me have to scramble to bag my own items quickly, before the next persons items come rolling in my direction. \nAlso why am I still getting charged for a Chicago Beverage Tax on my smoothie purchases??

This doesn't necessarily the quality is bad, just that these produce are not wanted at a quick rate elsewhere.\n\nThough, I would warn to only buy what you can eat within 3-4 days because it doesn't necessarily mean that everything is the freshest either.\n\nSome amazing finds that I was really excited about - .79 cent organic blueberries! Green beans .69 cents/lb! big ass bag of spring mix, $3.99! Red bell peppers .39 cents/lb!!

I've been to Stanley's throughout the last several years and I hate to say it, although prices are very affordable, the quality hasn't been great.

The baby bok choy looked ok, so I got a few of those. Their packaged herbs were a great deal $.98 for your choice of mint, basil, rosemary, or thyme and the citrus fruit and apples looked ok, but I surprisingly walked away with hardly anything.

It's located on the southwest corner of Elston and North Ave.  The sole choice of public transportation is the CTA #72 (North Ave.) bus.  Otherwise, it's a 20-minute walk westbound from the CTA North/Clybourn Red Line station.  \n\nIf you like organic veggies and fruit, Stanley's has awesome prices on them.  Forget your local W*ole Fo#ds.  Once you've shopped at Stanley's once, you are officially hooked!  \n\nThere's a juice bar and a deli meat counter.  However, I always go straight to find my everyday essentials: spinach, onion, green onion, tomatoes, strawberries, bananas, and apples.  By the way, their avocados are often priced very reasonably and ripened just right.  \n\nThey have a customer parking lot.

Tuesday evening I noticed the fruit was molding. \n\nPerhaps the fruit was marked down for a quick sale but there was no signage to indicate that. This was a good pack.

The deli area is also very good and they have a dairy/egg/packaged goods section that makes it a one stop shop! The pico is very tasty and tastes homemade. \n\nI order my meat online, so I don't need anything other than Stanley's! Even at crummy Jewel, my produce is $50+ and is usually rotten by the time I get home!\n\nThe parking can be cray...so don't go on Sunday afternoon. Otherwise, it's extremely accessible and even has a generous parking lot. Favorite grocery story ever with an amazing selection!",

            "description": "It's sad that there aren't more of these fresh markets around. I've been wanting to come here for awhile and I was able to snag a Groupon! ($20 for $30 worth). When in LP, I go to the Aldi/TJoes on Clybourn but Stanley's is comparable to Cermak Produce by my house in Bport.\n\nDefinitely made the mistake of going Sunday afternoon. We had to wait about five minutes for a parking spot to open up. We just waited until a customer was leaving, which was the strategy for others as well, so definitely dependent on luck on where you are situated relative to leaving customers. Could definitely see things being more hectic in the lot.\n\nRight away, I notice everything to be pretty cheap, some things even cheaper than that of Cermak. While others noted that things are super ripe and will go bad soon, this was not the case for me. The produce looked fresh there and after taking it home, all seem to be lasting their normal life span. At least, produce here (unlike Cermak - which I frequent), aren't sprayed with chemicals and preservatives. The produce at Stanley's is also of higher quality than that of Jewel and Mariano's (at least the ones in the LP area). While Aldi is stepping up their game of produce, it is still quite limited and things are small and prepackaged into groups (e.g. 2 small broccoli heads into 1 package). At Stanley's, you have many options and savings are even greater.\n\nLove that they have some ethnic staples like Chinese eggplant, bok choy, plantains, okra...and much more. They also have bean sprouts, which was impossible to find in all the grocery stores in the northside (including Jewel, Mariano's and Whole Foods).\n\nSome highlights for me... Spring mix by the lb.!!! I forgot how much per lb. exactly, but I was able to fill a giant bag which was enough salad for lunch for the week for under $2! Stanley's chips are fantastic and don't think I could eat generic chips loaded with MSG anymore. I tried the salt & vinegar but am dying to try other flavors (jalapeno, ranch, bbq)...a big bag for $2.99 (filled with chips and not air)! Their deli is awesome! 1/2 lb. of Boar's Head maple honey ham and 1/2 lb. of Boar's Head low sodium turkey for about the same price, maybe a smidgeon more, than Oscar Mayer's deli fresh lunch meat. A bunch (8?) bananas that were perfectly a little green that will ripen in a couple of days for $1! Also, a nice lookin' spaghetti squash for a dollar something!\n\nSo many other goodies I will let you to explore and discover yourself, but you can get majority of what you need here, as they do have pasta, coffee, canned beans and tomatoes...Almond milk was the only thing I found to be pricey here but to be expected. Also expected, they don't carry boxed items (cereal) and frozen items.\n\nDefinitely will try the juice bar some time and will have to make Stanley's a regular trip, but will come at a less popular time. Staff was also quite nice here!\n\n*I was looking on their website and apparently they will deliver your order the next day if you live within a 3 mile radius for a $3 delivery fee. Not sure how it all works with items being priced by the pound but even with the delivery fee, it's worth it imo, especially compared to the prices of the other grocery stores around.",

I'm normally a Whole Foods girl because I must have my organic fruits and veggies. However shopping at Whole Foods can be expensive, so I decided to give this place a try. It wasn't difficult to find the building sits on the corner of an intersection. There is plenty of parking space so you don't have to worry there. Ok so now on to the produce! The minute you hit the door you can't help but gawk at all the abundant colors of assorted fruits and veggies. I grabbed my basket and started shopping. However my excitement quickly faded when I realized there were limited options for organic produce, they didn't even have organic tomatoes. So to sum it up the prices are great but if buying organic is your thing this is not the place for you.",

I am so sad that Stanley's may soon cease to exist, with them putting up the property for sale...\n\n1) Fresh fruits and vegetables galore, with a small deli selection and a juice bar (!!!). Vegetarian paradise. Bulk spring mix and spinach bins! \n2) The super low cost specials are obviously for produce that's got a shorter shelf life, so buy those and take 'em home and cook ASAP. But they're so worth it. Today I got a 49 cent clamshell of strawberries that smelled amazing and immediately went into drink mixes/dessert. I also got a $1 pack of raspberries, and tons of vine ripe tomatoes that turned into pico de gallo and shakshuka. \n2) Very large variety, including organic at prices that remind me of conventional at J*wel or M*riano's... \n3) They have Amish eggs -- and duck eggs! The certification for organic is posted right next to the display. They also have a variety of Wisconsin cheeses, and a small sundry island with pasta/grains/etc. This is not the place for you to stock up your pasta arsenal, but should you need something for a vegetable forward dish you can snag it fairly reasonably here.\n4) Today I spent a whopping TWENTY DOLLARS on enough produce for a week and some change, with a few extras. I am currently enjoying some nice, crunchy 33 cent carrots with $1.49 hummus I picked up on special. \n\nWorth the trip. More free parking than the norm in Chitown.",

They have every vegetable you can imagine and all the staples for everyday living. But what's the best part?? It's super cheap!!! Here's the deal: they get nearly expired produce in the masses. Why it's good for you? It makes you eat lots of veggies and you get them at a great price! They even have an organic section!!! I love it here! I don't think my total have ever been over $35 for a week worth of veggies for a 3 girl house hold. You have to be careful with the fruit because it is truly very ripe and ready to go bad any day, but that's why the price is so good!\n\n I love coming here for juicing ingredients! Speaking of juice they recently added their own juice bar and it's awesome. Love me a green juice with tumeric booster on a Saturday morning. Speaking of morning: get there early. This place gets packed and it's small so you will have to wait for parking and be annoyed by the tightness if you go after 9am on the weekends. \n\nThe people that work there are super friendly from the people at the juice bar to the registers and the owner who you can sometimes catch at check out. Ugh I just love it here. Wish North Ave wasn't such a shit show all the time. I'd go more often",

So good that I actually make two grocery stops, first to Stanley's and then to jewel or Mariano's (only because Stanley's doesn't have meat/seafood or a large dry goods section). They definitely have the cheapest prices for produce in the city. Yes, a lot of it needs to be used within a few days, but you can still find fresh product there. They also just started selling some poultry items and I definitely suggest their Amish chicken breast. They have a great Deli counter, as well as a new salad bar and juice station. Their homemade pita chips are great as well and highly suggest their I homemade guacamole and salsa. Stanley's is a Chicago gem!",

For instance, a small box of strawberries at the entrance is usually $0.25. Customer service is always on point here, too. I've yet to have a less than stellar check out experience. The lines do get a little long, but they tend to move pretty quick. Anyway, they also have a limited selection of raw meats, and a pretty decent deli where you can get fresh carved turkey, cheeses, hams, and more. This is my go-to place for produce.

You are able to get high quality coffee, for slightly less than you would pay for at Starbucks.

It has busy lot busy store it's always packed full of shoppers. They are a good deal I'm glad to go there once in awhile when I can convince my husband to help me drive out there,",

They vary from week to week but the produce is consistently in decent shape, lasts at least four days from date of purchase (obviously some more than others - their sweet potatoes last FOREVER), and their staff is quick and friendly. \n\nThe only downfall I can think about is that it's pretty hard to get to via public transit but I always make it a priority to get there, somehow, at least once a week. \n\nGo!",

They even have a decent sized organic section!\n\nWe have been fans of Stanley's for many years (who doesn't love an entire case of strawberries for 98 cents??) but I felt compelled to post after shopping here while preparing for a juice cleanse.\n\nJuicing takes a LOT of produce and people think it gets really expensive. But if you can pick up the bulk of your produce at Stanley's it's very reasonable.\n\nLast week for less than $45 I picked up:\n\n6 bunches of organic kale\n1 head of organic romaine\n8 organic cucumbers\n20 green apples\n4 pears\n2 bunches of fresh ginger\n1 pack of fresh sage\n1 bunch of parsley\n1 bunch of cilantro\n5-6 yellow onions\n4 roma tomatoes\n1 pack cherry tomatoes\n1 fresh coconut\n10 limes\n8 lemons\n4 packs of organic celery\n2 zucchini\n2 acorn squash\n6 red peppers\n2 packs of blueberries\n2 portabello mushroom caps\n8 small avocados\n1 head of broccoli\n\nONE avocado is usually $2 at any other grocery store!\n\nThe key to Stanley's is to make it your first trip when grocery shopping. It's small and the cashiers are quick. Get in with your list and get what you can, then go to another store to get the rest of your items. What they have available changes frequently, they won't always have everything you want.\n\nThey do have awesome seasonal deals. In the summer its common to see flats of strawberries outside for $1/case (8 packs) or sweet corn for 10/$1. \n\nRight now they have pumpkins, squashes, gourds, and bales of hay out front for cheap for everyone who's doing their fall decorating.",

Stanley's selection and freshness can't be beat and for the most part, price, though a few exceptions you want to keep in mind.\n\nFor instance, there are random instances where price-wise you would do better, ie strawberries at  $4.50, Blueberries at nearly the same, where you could get them for around 1/2 that at the big chain grocers in the Chicago market.\n\nEnd of the day, this is where you should get most, if not all your fruits/veg and be happier and healthier for it, financially and otherwise.",

The items that are on sale are at a crazy low price and, yes, it is true that you should plan on cooking / eating them sooner than later.  But seriously people, you think that Whole Foods apple for 6x the price is really gonna last you THAT much longer?!?  I walk out of there with stuffed bags full of my favorites for less than $20!!

In general, everything is pretty good, but for example a couple days ago, the green lettuce was seriously wilted, there were moldy strawberries that were on sale. So just make sure you look at your produce well.\n\nHowever, I feel like this is a great place for very affordable fruit and veggies. Good amount of parking.

The produce is SO cheap like unbelievably so.  I literally would walk out with three giant bags full of fresh veggies and fruits for under $10! Some of the more notable deals I have seen- packs of blueberries, blackberries for 2/$1 (whaaaaaat???!).  One time I literally got three huge grocery bags full of bananas for a few bucks (smoothies!). They also always have great deals on loose Spinach and greens.  Some of their produce seems to be from Canada? Maybe that's why it's so cheap? Honestly I have no idea but I don't want it to stop.  They also have a great smoothie and fresh juice bar with a full salad bar as well which is incredibly affordable and way better than sweetgreen or other expensive salad chains.  They also sell eggs and cheese from local farmers which I like and am willing to pay a little more for.  They also have a deli in the back of the store that you can buy deli meats and cheese by the lb.  they have a good sized parking lot but if you come during rush hour- after work on weekdays and on afternoon weekends when everyone and their mother is trying to pick up groceries it may be harder to park.  I never have had an issue though.  Way to go Stanleys! They also have a great point system on an app and I've gotten $3, $5, off, free juices at times as well!!",

            "description": "Before you just walk into Stanley's and start buying up every last fruit and vegetable, all while telling yourself \"I saved so much money!\" It might help to pay attention to the price. I also think many shoppers make this mistake at larger corporations which require membership fees to even make a purchase. Right there, the $30/$50 you spend can be divided and added to the items you purchase over the year, and pretty much you come out even going anywhere else. I definitely have a limited income, and I secretly laugh at my friends who take me to these membership corporations, thinking they are doing me a favor. I watch them purchase items which are well over priced, or the same as anywhere else. \n\nMy visits to Stanley's (I have been here more than what my 2 check-ins reflect) are always hit or miss. Stanley's has had the best sale on asparagus I have ever seen at a produce market. Of course, this was last summer, and I am pretty sure it was during the asparagus season. Yes, for those shoppers who are not familiar with when produce is seasonal, you're really doing yourself a disservice and you need to do some research. When produce is in season, this means the pricing will come down. I hate cooking with a passion. If I am going to spend money on food, it better be a good deal. \n\nTypically I go with friends. I am usually aghast with what deals my culinary arts friends pass over. How can you be in the industry and not know a good deal when you see it? My last visit, I was alone, thank goodness, and decided to give this market a thorough investigation. Really, I was not impressed. Apples, like Danny W. had brought up, were priced much like a major chain would price out theirs. One of my health tricks is making sure I have apples. First, it takes more calories to burn off an apple, than the calories found in an apple. Second, I always eat an apple with a fatty meal because it slows down absorption of the fat into your system. Bottom line, I am always watching prices on apples. \n\nWhat I did notice was that Stanley's had a deli. Not even advertised as a sale, their lunchmeat was reasonably priced, even the roast beef! I also noticed their hummus was a decent price, if not typical, but I had never come across some of the flavors I found here. I can't wait to try the horseradish hummus! I got the last container so it must be a hot seller. \n\nYou may not find prices that seduce you, however, I am always impressed with the quality of their produce. Far beyond that of a major chain or any grocery store in Chicago (what is it with grocery stores in the city? Gross! Even the ones closest to the Gold Coast), Stanley's will always have produce which doesn't look like it has been bathed in pesticides... even if it has; or even if some of the produce has started to go bad. It still looks fresh and like a healthy decay. \n\nLike I have said, my beef with Stanley's would be their lack of consistently offering good deals on all of their produce. If you don't know your way around fruits and vegetables, then you're not going to come out ahead shopping here. I'm probably not doing myself much of a favor by driving all the way out to Skokie to shop, but I think it's worth the cost in gas just to encourage the Euro Markets to keep delivering fresh produce at an affordable price. Yes, I would much rather hand them my money.",

I assumed the quality would be noticeable inferior, but in general, that wasn't the case. In some instances, however, I passed on their selection... like avocados for example... I bought one small one for 50 cents I believe. It didn't look particularly great, and well, it didn't taste too good or last long enough as is typical of other avocados I've purchased. But for 50 cents, I am happy to have tried it for myself. For other items - tomatoes, apples, bananas, onions, peppers - I've had no issue. I spent $10 on what normally would have been at least $15, so I'm not complaining.\n\nI appreciate the one-stop shop atmosphere of most grocers but in the event I'm driving by, not in a rush, and in need of my week's bundle of produce, I'll certainly pop in Stanley's.",

I mostly come here for the veggies & fruits because honestly the quality AND quantity you get is amazing... It's hard to believe their prices are so low. I also tried a sandwich at their deli today & that too, was delicious. Even more so for just $4.99? Don't be scared of the lines, they move quickly & cashiers are polite. Worth the trip over!",

Ehhh it was alright but to be honest it's probably worth just paying the extra couple dollars at fresh thyme, whole foods or some other local store. A lot of the vegetables aren't fresh, they are older and will probably go bad within a couple days which is why I didn't buy much. Also a lot of fruit flies around certain fruits and vegetables which sort of freaks me out. It's worth going to check out and get a few good things like I found great kale, nectarines and cherry tomatoes but some stuff definitely don't buy. Go check it out though :)",

In the last couple of years they have added a deli counter (prices are a little high here) and a homeade potato chip machine (there is always a bowl for free samples...the chips are pretty good...if you do not trust me check out Kevin A's review...he is installing one in his bedoom!).\n\nThey have the best prices on fruits and vegetables.  I can walk out with 4 bags full and spend like 15 bucks...it would cost me 40 bucks at Jewel or Dominicks and 75 bucks at Whole Foods (if we are tallking organic).\n\nSometimes the Organic is even cheaper here then there regualr produce.\n\nPlease avoid this place on the weekend or after work because it is a nightmare.  I expect to see some fights but people are always very pleasent to each other...it must be all of that money they are saving.",

But in 2016, Stanley's is definitely a five star spot!\n\nSome things I've learned over the years about Stanley's...\n- Wash everythinggg. I've seen things...like a kid grabbing random handfuls from the spinach (at least he's eating spinach?!)... And all kinds of produce go rolling off the pile and down the aisle, then put right back. (I do it too, guilty! But still... Clean yo stuff!)\n- If there's a Crazy good deal on something outside, like 12 containers of blueberries for $3...look at the 12 you choose closely, and use them how you want right away. Also prepare for some inevitable mold picking.\n- The employees are usually very nice and knowledgable, especially the girls who work at the juice bar! So sweet! But if you see someone out on the floor, feel free to ask how to know if a certain item is ripe or not, ask what something is, or if they have more/better ones in the back.\n- With that, if the leaves pull easily from a pineapple it's ready to eat Then, stay away from papaya...it's basically dirty feet fruit (bleh) and if there's only 2 picked over containers of bluebs left, ask, they probably have more in the back that just hasn't been restocked. \n- Finally, get the sweet potato chips. Just do it. The saying I noticed on the back of the bag alone makes it worth the cost -- Chicago hipsters become Stanley's chipsters! Ahhahaha \n\nKeep rockin, Stanley's! See you soon ;)",

I like shopping here but sometimes I'm not in the mood to be getting hit on by strangers!  I don't know if it's the Wicker Park/Lincoln Park hipster clientele or the 80s soundtrack or what but people seem to be really checking each other out.  Is it just me??\nI feel like I'm usually going around the evening rush hour so maybe people have pent up sexual energy from being at work all day.  Also it feels like maybe everyone is married or partnered and can't go out to singles bars anymore so going to the grocery store is when they get the chance to strut their stuff and be flirty and sexual in public.  \nI have had so many girls (and guys) checking me out here that I have looked around to see if there are hidden cameras or something.  It feels like being inside an SNL skit when you're holding a squash or squeezing a cantaloupe and then you see someone across the aisle making bedroom eyes at you while \"Come On Eileen\" plays at club volume.  \nThat said, this place has an amazing selection and pretty incredible prices across the board.  We are often working on TV shoots in this neighborhood and it's wonderful to be able to walk over and grab healthy snacks while everyone else is stuffing their faces with Potbelly and Chipotle catering.  They have great hummus, baba gannouj, peanuts, cheeses, pretty good bread, chips, and of course tons of amazing fresh vegetables.  \nThe only thing that stresses me out is feeling like I have to be looking my best for the hot yoga moms and young beardy weirdos on the prowl.  Well, I guess that's why the good lord invented baseball hats and sunglasses.",

It's almost as if the registers can't count higher than that.  Simply amazing.  \n\nThings I accept:\n- this produce will go bad...very quickly.  I'm assuming that's how they get it so cheap\n\nThings I like:\n- Very good pita in the back near the deli\n- Deli is CHEAP and decent meats (not Boar's Head but hey, decent)\n- Carry organic eggs & essentials in case you don't want to do a grocery run\n- intelligentsia coffee!\n- good dried fruit selection\n\nThings I love:\n- the wall of deals when you first walk in\n- how ridiculously cheap carrots are - love carrots.\n- how ridiculously cheap (almost) everything is.  \n- Again, something about cheap-ness\n- Did I mention it's cheap?",

I have yet to see aging products and everything is fresh and well maintained. \n\nTIP: The store is SUPER CLEAN! (and AWESOME!)\n\nAlong one side you'll find exclusively organic options, there's also a great deli towards the back of the store. A case against the back wall has generous portions of prepackaged fresh herbs for the cheapest prices you'll find anywhere, and who doesn't love cooking with FRESH HERBS?! I believe I last paid about $1 for a giant bunch of fresh rosemary as an example.\n\nJump on the kale train-- they carry several varieties including organic and red (purple) kale and WAY cheaper than Whole Foods and most of the healthful food stores (about $1 a bunch)\n\nThe staff here genuinely seems like the like their jobs and have always been friendly and helpful.

(unless it's a root vegetable, like an onion or potato.) \n\nthe store was clean, in fact there was an employee going through the store cleaning the aisles and two employees weeding through the produce. the cashier was very nice. yes, the aisles are narrow. but in this fast paced life: get over it. this is a great store with an awesome variety and they carry many specialty items (pasta, Amish sweet cream butter, juice, olives, olive oils, on and on..)\n\ndefinitely a gem.",

Look before you purchase, because like anywhere else, quality control is ultimately in your hands. I find some things to be consistently good: lettuce, garlic, broccoli, cherry tomatoes, basil, jalapeno peppers, parsley, mushrooms, etc.\n\nOther things require closer inspection: onions, shallots, avocado, peppers, etc.\n\nAll in all, worth the savings even if it means you might have to stop by another store to pick up the items that didn't look so great here.\n\nDon't skip the potato chip machine - Jiminy chips are worth the splurge!",

You could do a lot of shopping at Stanley's, but all of the non-fresh items will run up your bill and it won't be worth it.

Get over yourself.  You cannot have produce be dirt cheap and also be the same as going to Whole Foods.  You just let your little noggen work hard enough, and you'll realize that the laws of economics do not permit this.  \n\nAlso, Americans are pretty dumb when it comes to shopping.  They think that they can buy perishables once a week and nothing will go bad.  Nowhere else in the world is this an expected norm and only exists here because of produce that is unripe and needless amounts of refrigeration.  Europeans will shop upwards of everyday to find produce and cheese that is just right and eat it today and tomorrow.  \n\nStock your pantry with dry goods and canned goods.  Keep some proteins in the freezer.  Buy your produce, meat, and fish at least twice a week and quit bitching that Stanley's isn't Whole Foods.  BTW, who are the idiots who can't navigate the parking lot?  It's full, okay. Wait a couple minutes, listen to one of your TED talks that make you feel like you're smart, and someone will come out of the store and leave.",

I no longer live convenient to it, but since it's on a thoroughfare that I traverse frequently, occasionally I will stop in for some groceries if I am going to be cooking that night. \n\nAnd that's the key to buying from Stanley's because most of the produce they sell is already ripe (and sometimes rotten) and ready to use. It's not a place to stock up on produce for the week because it just doesn't keep. One time I was there and I couldn't believe they were selling raspberries for $.79 a half pint; that is until I looked at them and almost all of them were half moldy. There was a guy standing next to me restocking the shelves who saw my look of dismay and just shrugged at me as if to say \"What do you expect for $.79?\" \n\nHaving said that, the prices are crazy cheap, but again, it's not a bargain if you end up throwing out half of what you bought. Plan accordingly, and you'll do fine. \n\nI've scored great deals here: fresh herbs for $.69, limes that are 10 for a $1.00, and every once in a blue moon, they even sell tiny avocados for $.25. Finding those are a major score because sometimes I can't use an entire regulation-size avocado and these are like \"personal-sized\" ones; perfect for a salad for just me. \n\nLike I said, I only shop here sporadically as my produce allegiance lies with my neighborhood store, HarvesTime, but Stanley's works in a pinch if you time it just right.\n\nps - the parking lot is a complete clusterfluff, no matter when you go, so consider yourself warned.",

I can literally feed an army for like $10. \n\nOrange peppers on sale for 5 cents a pound? Apples for 39 cents a pound? A whole pineapple for $2? Blackberries for 79 cents? I find myself asking at least 3-5 questions like these everytime I go. I am amazed literally every time. And the best part is, the produce lasts at least a week! It's not the worst in quality for such prices. \n\nSometimes I feel like the cashier is going to laugh at me for buying $5 of groceries but no, this is normal to them and they're always super nice. I walk  out with my bags and bags of groceries and feel, awesome. \n\nThey also make their own awesome potato chips and have a deli counter. I can't vouch for the deli counter prices being the cheapest but I don't think they're bad either.\n\nI drive out of my way to go here because it's simply the best! Now they just need to sell all my other groceries (milk, eggs, etc.) and we'd be set.",

Let me tell you why: Stanley's makes me eat healthier. \n\nYou're right, Stanley doesn't fly his watermelon plane over to my house and stuff kale in my face until I gag, but going to Stanley's allows me to buy the quantity and volume of produce I want to have on hand to make better food choices. Need a quick side for dinner? Thanks to Stanley's, I have 5 lbs. of spinach and three bulbs of garlic. Voila! Side dish. Breakfast smoothies every day? No need for $30 in kale from Whole Foods. I got it at Stanley's for six bucks.\n\nThe only downside is that the prices are so low because the produce is already ripe. You have a couple of days, a week max to finish off most of your goods before they spoil. Oftentimes, I fail at this and have to throw some out. But honestly, what's the big deal with throwing out 70 cents of old raspberries? At least I had them to snack on for a couple days.",

I love Stanley's in the same way that I love thrift stores: The price point is so low that I never have to say no to myself. Whereas in my local Dominick's, I'll have to barter with myself (\"If I get two tomatoes, that means I'll have to get only one cucumber\"), at Stanley's I get whatever appeals to me -- hell, I usually get two of whatever appeals to me, because I can.\n\n2. For vegetarians, this place is a one-stop shop. In addition to mounds of fruits and vegetables, Stanley's also has a deli, where they sell good sliced cheeses (and deli meat, if you're into that), and a variety of breads, coffees, dried fruits, teas, dips (so.much.hummus) and canned beans -- essentially all I eat -- at the same low prices. \n\nI seriously go here every Monday to restock for the week for less than $15. I would high-five Stanley if I ever met him in person.",

I have been going to Stanley's for the past year, and I must say their prices beat competitors such as Whole Foods and Mariano's. This seasonal Farmer's Market is perfect for people who don't mind to find veggies by the season. Their produce are fresh and they have a great selection of organic products as well. One of the main reasons why I noticed customers go there is because of their juice bar. I think the juice bar is a wonderful addition. The prices are amazing! I have been going there on a daily basis because of their juice bar and how inexpensive prices are . From $2.99 as opposed to paying  $9.99 by  Wicker Park area. I also love their wheat grass shot. The only sad part is that not everyday they carry  wheat grass shots :(.  Recently they added a new salad bar. For now, I'll stick to the fresh juices.  I Will definitely keep going there for  fresh vegetable juice and seasonal veggies.",

I pains me to say the carrots, celery, spinach and kale I get at Cost Co all have a longer life once I get it home than what I drag home from good old fashioned Stanley's . It's a sad day when the produce market I bragged about is out done by the local IKEA of frozen cheeseburgers and potato chips.\n\nThere are still plenty of deals for in season fruits and vegetables and those are usually pretty safe for a day or two.  The window advertized items are always such dramatic discounts my frugality often finds itself semi-erect.   They also always have beets and a nice rack of organic produce.  But the difficult intersection just north and the increasing prevalence of good cheap produce elsewhere has taken my old school, no brainer, 5 star produce market and turned it into just another place.\n\nI do hit them early when my schedule requires it and 6am unlocked doors makes them unique.

Sure, there are times that things in the isles are at their peak and need to be eaten that day, while other times they've got a week or so until they're ripe.  That goes for anywhere I buy produce.  It's not like the apples or cucumbers are in a box, and I don't know what to expect.

Every time I have been in there, people are restocking and checking to make sure nothing has gone bad. The sales and produce options change seasonally. Sometimes I look at my receipt and laugh at how much I payed for something here vs. what I payed at Jewel. You can not beat the prices and selection. They also have a decent dairy section and meat counter. \n\nA warning to people who don't enjoy crowds...it gets super jammed on Sundays and certain times during the week.The parking lot can also be kind of crazy. Don't even attempt a cart unless you have a specific plan of action. It's worth it though, so get your list together and put your game face on. Fifteen dollars and ten minutes later you will have a huge pile of fruit and veggies for the week!",

Otherwise, you need to be careful or you may just wind up throwing money away.\n \nOrganic chard went pathetically limp within only a couple of days. Green onions that looked great in the store did the same thing. Apricots were over-ripe in a day. I've never seen these kinds of items do that so quickly. And while I don't know if it's the norm, the day I went most of the delicate leafy vegetables piled high were already just as limp and sad looking as the chard became. You might be able to crisp them up, but that's extra effort (with no guarantee it'll work) that I'm not sure you should have to do.",

That was like 4 pounds of potatoes, bunches of onions, okra, cellary, peppers, and more for next to nothing.\n\nMy one complaint is it is not a 1 stop shop. But who cares? Stop there on your way home and get your veggies for the week or two. Then later to to Mariano's for meats and whatnot. You won't regret it",

My favorite time to go is weekday mornings- it's not nearly as busy, which means I'm able to get in and out quickly.\n\nOne warning, though- don't go there expecting to find some type of rare fruit or vegetable.  Or even a more common one that's fresh.  I find it's better to go in with an open mind, that way I'm able to buy the cheapest, freshest fruits and veggies.  Sometimes you can get a carton of strawberries for under a dollar.  Other times, it'll run you $4.  You never know, so be aware of that.\n\nBottom line, though: Stanley's is the best, and it's saved me some serious money in the past couple years.  Stop by sometime- you'll see what I mean.",

Their price per pound on organic, seasonal, and non-seasonal produce beats Dominick's or Jewel any day. Like many people have said before, if you need something specific that is not really common, you may not find it. Other side of that coin is they will have some obscure produce that's pretty cool to pick up and experiment with. \n\nTheir \"pantry\" items like pasta, or anything prepackaged are not a great savings, so if you are really watching your budget, shop around for those. They are not going to break the bank either.  \nI have found, like some other people, that they will sometimes(very rarely) advertise a price and not have that price at the register. Although it's not usually too far off, and it's STILL cheaper than what I would pay elsewhere, so... it happens.\nOne of the things that I absolutely LOVE is their fresh herbs that typically go for about $.98 per pack which is a SCREAMIN' deal.",

The other day, I didn't have time to head to Harvesttime, so I figured I'd swing in quickly and grab few things.  Worst $7 I've ever spent.  \n\nLet's start with this...they had no sweet onions.  Seriously.  None. Could I have gotten a Spanish onion?  Sure, but I wanted a sweet onion.  The worst Jewel in Chicago has sweet onions.  Lord.\n\nThere literally isn't one piece of produce in that store that isn't damaged in some way.  It's all a little too ripe or beaten up or weirdly colored.  It's awful.  \n\nThere are a number of fruit markets in this city...venture to Harvesttime or Edgewater or that one place on Kedzie or Kimball or something.  Go to a farmers market for the next few months.  \n\nIt makes me happy that folks shop at a fruit market instead of just a chain grocery, but you're all picking the wrong one.",

I'm talking \"swoon\" as in what happens to the Cubs perennially almost every June.  The produce in Stanley's does the same daily.\n\nI think it was that Carson Kressley guy from that show on Bravo years ago who said something to the effect that it's better to have a few nice, quality pieces rather than a bunch of junk.  You would be wise to heed that advice sartorially as well as when you visit Stanley's.  \n\nYelp has 500 reviews for Stanley's, with an aggregate rating of four stars.  Well, I've now visited Stanley's, and I can say that rating Stanley's four stars in the aggregate is tantamount to rating Payless Shoe Source or Chernin's four stars.  Are you going to rate those establishments four stars?  Surely not.  Price is not everything, people.\n\nOf course, the intriguing things about Stanley's were the prices as well as the stratospheric rating on Yelp, so I ventured up Elston to see for myself.  Well, color me unimpressed.\n\nI'm sorry, it doesn't matter how inexpensive something is if it's not going to be quality.  Remember your Carson Kressley, people.  There's no way I'd ever buy fruit at Stanley's, as, from what I saw, the poor little buggers are already in hospice and close to the end.  Grapes?  No.  Raspberries?  Certainly not!  And I thought the raspberries at Jewel usually didn't look very good.  Wow.  Really makes me wistful for the raspberry bush outside our house, from which we could pluck perfectly fresh from the vine berries.  And then there was the baby spinach sitting unpackaged in a pile about as high as Mount Whitney that appeared to be melting into guacamole.  I believe I'll be sticking to my pre-packaged, six-dollar containers of baby spinach from Jewel, thanks.  \n\nThe only things I'd go back to Stanley's to buy would be broccoli and onions.  Oh, they also stock Intelligentsia, so I'd grab a bag of that as well.  Sadly, it's not priced as cheaply as the produce, but you know it's worth it.  And that's the point of this whole review - to buy based on quality rather than price because cheap things fall apart and don't last. \n\nIt's really just not worth it.  Two stars.",

I get a great amount of fresh produce and even a kale juice for a total of  $20 or less. I can certainly understand some of the reviews regarding fruit or vegetables that are not as hard or as crisp as you may find at the larger chain grocery store, there is a difference in the products sold at Stanley's and its freshness. If your eyes can't tell the difference your stomach and gut will certainly thank you for eating this good food as nature intended it to be. I also prefer most of my fruits and vegetables cooked due to my diet restrictions so softer works well for me. There is parking one thing to mention, People, there are two ways into the parking lot, but only one way out please look for the arrows, it makes things so much less difficult.

What are we supposed to do--Purell every tiny leaf to the point of bacterial elimination once we get home?\n\nThis place is filthy.  No, I really mean it.  Messy floors, no sneeze guard over the olives, mushy overripe tomatoes and molding strawberries left outdoors that look 1-2 days past due.\n\nGranted, a lot of what I wanted isn't in season yet, and I shopped late Saturday afternoon.  Still, there's no reason for this store to look the way it did.  There's no flow to the way things are laid out except for the way they put their organic veggies in one area.  And what's with the signage being so difficult to read and understand in some areas?  One stack of navel oranges read 49 cents/pd.  Another read 69 cents/pd.  The organic navels were 29 cents/pd.  Huh?\n\nThey had a lot of produce...but why did most of the fruit look smaller and of  lesser quality than the selection in full-service grocery stores?  Sure, they had a stack of Asian pears, but they were horrid looking--the skins were pot-marked and had little cuts; usually, these are the most beautiful pears in grocery stores.  There was a sign that said they *should* have blood oranges; nope.  Iceberg lettuce?  Well, the heads of lettuce they had were sealed in plastic containers for $2.97/head.  Ouch.  Even worse were most of the dry goods--that seems to be where they make their most profit.  A small container of pistachios was $7!  At Jewell, that same bag would have been $4.  A loaf of whole-grain bread here was $4.50; at Whole Foods it would've been $3.75.\n\nIt's not worth me taking a train and two buses to get here, then walk a block along a less than pleasant stretch of North Avenue (Note to Alderman: FIX THE BROKEN SIDEWALKS.  Not everyone drives an SUV to get to retail stores around this area).  Everything taken into consideration, I'll stick with my Lakeview Treasure Island for great produce.

            "description": "This place is AMAZING!  I can walk in here, buy full two bags worth of fruits and veggies, and pay ten bucks.  TEN DOLLARS!  Yeah, the stuff goes bad pretty quick, but do you really care if you are only paying fifty cents or less for each item?  \n\nAnd the trick with that is to get the veggie bags/containers that absorb the gas emitted from the veggies.  Yes, they really work and yes, they do make the veggies last almost two weeks or longer in some cases.  (And, air purifiers for your refrigerator also have been known to extend it past that.)",

This place is a cornucopia of vegetables (and now I'm happy that I just worked cornucopia into my review). Seriously, it's like a vegan's dream. Granted, I'm far from vegan and I was still kinda going bonkers. So, why the 4* instead of 5*? I'll get to that at the end. \n\nThe prices here are absurd. When I say absurd, I mean on the low end. I loaded up on all sorts of produce and it only cost me like $35. That was after me adding a medium size of their own olive oil which took care of about $14 worth on the bill. Yea, pretty sweet. \n\nThe quality of the veggies was pretty good on the whole. You can get a ton of different things from here in various sizes. You can get all of the peppers and onions that you can imagine along with a whole ton of garlic too. \n\nNow, to answer why it's 4 instead of 5*. Everything didn't last as long as I was expecting. By the 5th day, most of the peppers were turning and I had yet to fully get into the bag of tomatoes that I bought. I had to dump them all as I just didn't want to try to salvage what little fruit and veggies that were still good. A bit sad, but considering how affordable it all was, I'll deal with it and just buy enough for immediate use next time.",

Plus, the specials are great and should be taken advantage of.\n- If the parking lot is crazy, drive south a little on Elston; there is always parking\n- If you get something for a crazy low price (a pallet of strawberries for $1 or tomatoes for .20 a pound), be sure to process/use them immediately.  I buy the strawberries and freeze them, puree, and make jam.\n- Definitely check out the fresh herbs and sun dried tomatoes in the back by the milk; great value!\n\nHope you enjoy Stanley's as much as I do!",

Yes, maybe you can't do ALL your shopping here and may need to hit another store, but otherwise it is perfect! This place is a godsend if you are a bit short on cash some weeks. I very rarely pick anything from there that isn't organic so my options can be limited. But thanks to this place on my limited income I can stay organic! The organics are found towards the back of the store to your left, before the deli. The options they do have are amazing. It's my own little treasure hunt. Just a few weeks ago the guy was putting out gorgeous, ORGANIC grapes at .69/lb! I grabbed two bags and by the time my friend went the next day they were gone. They don't seem to post their deals anywhere online so some days it's blah and other times you walk out with a huge grin at the awesome specials you got. For me and my toddler who have been in a 'grape desert' since we won't eat non-organic ones and have to depend on seasonality this day was one of the GRIN days! I can often find organic bananas and potatoes here too. Their greens selection is awesome, they always have beautiful kale, swiss chard and spinach. Also big carrots for juicing. They have a wonderful organic dairy section and some prepared stuff too. Their deli is great too, a bit pricier than at my usual grocers but in a pinch to save me a trip I've bought stuff. I love their local bread selections too. They even have organic whole wheat for $2.99! A whole shelf of fresh herbs and 'fill up your own olive oil' station is nice too. They also have Fair trade coffee and sometimes they have ridiculous doorbuster deals. Just a few months back they were selling CASES of strawberries for 50 cents each..like 10 pints in one case! They weren't organic though or else I would've grabbed one and made preserves for everyone I know! :) I don't know what people are saying about the produce not lasting. I think it's a good thing if my produce isn't bionic and stays fresh in my fridge for weeks..it's supposed to spoil, no? I do often have to hit another store to complete my shopping as I can't always find all my produce needs there but that is only because I'm organic. Depending on the season I can get all I need. Between this and Costco my produce needs are usually met just fine. I have zero need for Whole foods or even Trader Joes much anymore.  It is  an amazing gem for us Chicagoans. I agree with other posters...maybe we should stop bragging about the joint before it's overrun by everyone!! they do accept credit cards and SNAP as well.\n\nPS: They also sell frozen lou malnatti pizzas for about $12 each. One feeds the three of us comfortably so it's nice to keep one in the freezer for lazy days! Cheaper than ordering in!",

Quality is roughly comparable with fruit and produce in most good grocery stores. As with any such store, the shopper himself must evaluate any fruit or vegetable with regard to its freshness, ripeness, and so on. However, Stanley's might turn over its inventory more often than the average grocery store, which would be good for the shopper.\n\nStanley's has a full deli. It sells some canned goods and some specialty items, for example, bulk olive oil (fill your own bottle). Since I don't shop at Stanley's for anything except fruit and produce, I can't comment on the rest of the store's offerings.",

Directly across from the herbs is a bay of spring mixed salad. This is the first I have ever seen, you grab a bag and fill it with this pre-mixed salad per pound. Which If I may add is fresher and half the cost of pre-bagged varieties. \nFinal note is their deli department is $1-$2 cheaper per pound on all their meats compared to Jewel this really helped for my lunches all week long. While standing in line you cannot pass up the chance to sample some of their fresh made right in front of you potato chips. They have quite the variety of chip flavors to choose from. \n\nI have recommended this place to over 5 people in the last week and plan to continue.",

I know the prices are tough to beat, which is why I find myself all-of-a-sudden inside the place every 1 to 2 weeks. However I'm not sure it's always worth it. \n\nI thought I could go there for a couple days or even try to stretch it to a week's worth of food. Go through it quickly so it has no time to rot. Sometimes that works, but other times I just strike out. I've sifted through piles and piles of red onions and avocados in hopes of the perfect pick. But to my sadness, when I get home, I've found damaged goods on the inside. Or sometimes, that perfectly shaped, colored and textured avocado tastes like a shoe. The fresh herbs (parsley and cilantro mainly) always look pretty but when used to cook with taste very bitter.\n\nI suppose it's a matter of what day and time you go there. Also what type of produce you get. You can usually win with peppers, broc, celery and apples. The canned food there usually never fails either. \n\nThe deli options are awesome, although there's a grouch or two behind the counter every-so-often, but I guess that doesn't really bother me as I'm driving home with some buffalo style chicken breast and creamy havarti at my side. The homemade potato chips are delicious.",

            "description": "Stanley's is epic, simply for the reason that they sell produce SO much cheaper than you get it anywhere else.  Go from Stanley's to Whole Foods produce section and you will be like a man who was frozen during the depression and just woke up to current day prices.  It's that stark of a contrast.\n\nWhen I go here, I am normally looking to stock up.  Their bread and butter is their produce, but they have a deli now, freshly made bread, milk, and other fresh products.  My mind develops grandiose dinner plans where I will sautee, peel, and core until my hands bleed while I am walking around.  These ideas always get toned down when life gets in the way, and I am usually left throwing out some produce.\n\nThat would be my one issue with Stanley's, and the only reason it does not get 5 stars.  The produce will turn.  Fast.  Oops, too late, it's already bad.  Certain things like apples and oranges will last a while, but you should plan on eating most things in the next 2-3 days, and strawberries and raspberries will go bad before that.  \n\nAs little added bonuses, they normally keep everything stocked so nothing has that \"picked over\" look.  The workers are pretty friendly and helpful, and the store is usually clean.  Except maybe that one woman in the deli section.  She always looks like you are hassling her when she has to slice up some meat.\n\nI come here when I can, and I recommend you do the same.  Seeing a whole basket of food add up to $25 really reminds you of what a dollar is worth.",

Stanley's carries a very limited selection of other products, but you should be able to find a gallon of milk, a dozen eggs, and a loaf of bread.\n\nPay attention to the produce as it is more likely to be aging than at your full-service supermarket.

Apples I'd never heard of for prices lower than I'd ever seen made me reach over and squeeze my boyfriend.  We started singing. \n\nAt checkout, when I saw the amount was less than $27, I told the lady checking us out that it was my first time there, and I was so happy about the prices that I was going to go home and eat it all and come back tomorrow to buy it again.

            "description": "Why did I not know about this place sooner? As soon as I walked into Stanley's for the first time, I was shocked. I mean, I saw the signs on the windows and that's what drew me in, but I didn't believe a produce store could be this cheap. Clementines for $2? Target had them for $5 - and I thought that was cheap! A carton of Strawberry's for $1.50? a Bag of baby carrots for $1? These are unheard of prices in Chicago. \n\nSome people think this place is shady, but I really can't see how. This place has been in business since forever. Also, the produce is flawless. OK, so maybe I've seen some bruises here and there, but so what? I'd rather get a bruise on a pear than pay triple the price at Jewel Osco for ultimately the same thing. The taste is fine. You can freeze the produce from Stanley's and use it weeks later (I've done it serveral times).\n\nNeedless to say, I don't even mess with buying produce anywhere else anymore - and I even live on the South Side (Hyde Park). During my weekly journey's to the North Side to go to Petco or ULTA, I stop at Stanley's to stock up on my week's worth of fruit and veggies. For $20, I can fill both drawers in my fridge and even pop a couple things in the freezer for saving. I've never been able to afford \"organic\" fruit or veggies, and guess what, now I can!\n\nMy hubby and I have never had it so good. He gets the berries he loves. I get my Spinach, avacados, and mushrooms. My Mother-in-law will never have to worry again about her wonderful son not getting his veggies. At these prices, I've got her beat. We can easily get all of our servings of veggies/fruits in one sitting thanks to Stanley's.\n\nThe Jiminy chips toward the deli counter are delicious, but dangerous. Once I saw the words \"gluten-free,\" I took it upon myself to scarf an entire bag of the Apple-Cinnamon chips. Although they made a fabulous lunch, I'm sure \"gluten-free\" does not mean \"calorie-free.\" I will stay away from that chip counter for a while...\n\nThey also have Pico De Gallo in the fridge section sometimes and it is so good! Again, something you can scarf in one sitting if not careful. I also just bought a container of really juicy pineapple on sale for $1.98 - which is cheaper than a large can of pineapple at Dominicks. It was good enough to eat with a fork straight of the container...\n\nNeedless to say, check out Stanley's and enjoy the savings and great produce!",

Mind you, I've NEVER done this before but for some reason, I just HAD to do it.\n\nAfter doing a little research, it seemed fairly simple to make but I needed an ingredient I had never heard of before--Scotch bonnet peppers. WTF are those? I figured Whole Check probably had them but since I didn't want to spend a ton of money there, I headed over to Stanley's. Wow! Stanley's had an incredible selection of fresh fruits and vegetables at very low prices and I was able to get almost everything I needed. They did not, however, have the Scotch bonnet peppers, so I called a buddy who knew how to make the seasoning and he said I could use habaneros instead.\n\nMy buddy took the wind out my sails when he later told me that the whole jerk chicken-making process is a bit more complicated than what I thought, but I did take solace in the fact that I didn't spend a small fortune for the ingredients.

            "description": "Being a personal chef, I'm always looking for fresh and in season produce. In a city as large and with as much depth as Chicago, I find it almost inexcusable to purchase such wares from the Jewels and Dominicks who dominate nearly every block. The produce is often rotting and the prices are often higher. Simple lesson here: the price is higher due to the wares in question being shipped in from farther off locales - due to the length of the beginning origin to final destination, the wares have lost much of their luster along the way - this equals crap product at exorbitant prices a good majority of the time.\n\nWith Stanley's, you can shop knowing things are (for the most part) coming from local if not atleast Midwestern based sources as opposed to far left or right coasts. A couple of months back during the great strawberry debacle where farmers were yielding far more than they knew what to do with, I picked up a couple of boxes of strawberries for under $10 and proceeded to make enough preserves to last until the end of time (or atleast the end of April - at present, we're down to the last jar).\n\nMost all of my produce shopping is allocated to either here or to the branch of the Cermak chain in Humboldt park. Why? Fresh produce at lower prices. Simple. Simple. Simple.\n\nIf you don't mind skipping out on Whole Foods (not a knock, they're great at what they do, but you oughta know that they're charging you the name 'Organic' every time you spend two bucks on a yam), this should be one of your only stops in the city. Support Midwestern and locally grown goods (don't pay attention to the swirling marquee for the store though - a guy smoking a cigar while sitting in a watermelon? Any chef worth his weight in cumin will tell you that's just plain unsanitary!)",

That said, there are always excellent deals here, some of the cheapest food in the city.  For example, yesterday they had containers of raspberries and strawberries for $1.  They also had mangoes for $2.50/box.  This is a perfect place to pick up ingredients for a meal that you're cooking later in the evening for guests, or food to use in a dish-to-pass at a pot luck.",

Not because of this store, but just because others who shop here expect that produce from Stanley's to last as long as it does from Jewel. Listen, the prices are WAY cheaper. The quality is WAY better. Hell, I can get organic produce here for cheaper than regular produce at a chain store. If you buy the guacamole made by Stanley's, make sure to have a safe house to hide it at.... Surely your family will be devouring it as soon as it walks through the door. Yes, the produce does not last quite as long, but my highly unresearched and unscientific methods suggest that it may be because it's not manufactured with all the yummy additives and pesticides that the industrial food complex pumps out.",

I'm not alone in thinking this either as the parking lot is generally completely packed and backing up traffic on Elston. I noticed some Yelpers comment that some of the fruit/veggies aren't that fresh. This is simply not true. Sometimes they might have overstock of something in season and will give penny prices so that the produce goes fast. In purchasing fruit for pennies you should understand that its not going to last more than a day or two. Duh...\n\nI'd recommend going really early or really late if you want to do your shopping without it being too full of other customers, but it's not a bad store for eye-candy either. \n\nYou'll find their IMPORT products like Greek candies and Greek Extra Virgin Olive Oil to be on the expensive side, but that's pretty common anywhere you go for that stuff. \n\nI'd recommend Stanley's to anyone who wants to find a great deal.$\n\nCheck it out, and you might just become a regular.",

A whole month!\n\nI brought it back and was treated very poorly by the manager on duty. He basically accused me of lying. We got into an almost heated argument over when I bought the milk. I had a receipt, but no matter. I have never been treated like that by anyone before when trying to return a bad product. The arguing went on for almost 5 minutes. I finally left with a new gallon of milk and a terrible taste in my mouth. \n\nAs if I would buy milk, let it sit in my fridge for a month and then try to return it.

            "description": "Stanley's is great.  While they primarily stock large quantities of cheap and fresh produce (organic and conventional); they also have a deli and sell spices, coffee, and limited pantry staples.  If they started selling Diet Coke and beer, I would never have to shop anywhere else.  \n\nThe main reason I am able to shop at Stanley's is because I am only selectively picky and can be spontaneously flexible.  Here's the thing: Stanley's offers low prices, but I'm never positive what those low prices will be on; that's the glory of Stanley's and how they are able to offer such low prices.  You can't go into Stanley's planning to buy some cheap strawberries, because honestly?  They might not even have expensive strawberries.  However, you might walk into Stanley's and find perfect (and perfectly priced!) pineapple, parsnips, and persimmons.  You kind of have to go with the flow.\n\nI made up a game that I call The Stanley's Game.  It's a winter game, mostly due to time and my inevitable boredom with winter produce.  I purchase something out of the norm which looks cheap and fresh...and then I take it home and figure out what to do with it.  (Usually this involves some sort of oven roasting or saut\u00e9ing; occasionally it involves muffins.)    There are wins and losses in the game, but it encourages me to try new things and new recipes.\n\nStanley's isn't fancy, but I don't need my produce stand to be fancy.  Produce comes from the ground and grows outside.  While Whole Foods has its charms, so does Stanley's.  The only thing that prevents me from giving five stars is the inconsistency/mystery of their stock.  Granted that's part of its charm, but making multiple stops when I really want strawberries isn't super charming.",

I pulled in to the lot and was delighted to see giant boxes full of pumpkins.  I was even more delighted to see a big hand printed sign taped to the front of the store that proclaimed \"PUMPKINS - .19 / LB.\" Nineteen cents a pound, that's awesome!\n\nI loaded up a cart with 20 pumpkins, also picked out some decorative gourds and proceeded to the checkout.  I was chatting away with my friend for a while and then glanced at the register screen.\n\n$.79 per pound for the pumpkins is what the cashier was charging me.\n\nI said: \"Excuse me, the sign out front says $.19 per pound.\"\n\nShe said: \"The $.19 is for the big pumpkins, these little ones are $.79.\"\n\nI said: \"There are no big pumpkins in your entire store, and the only sign near these pumpkins said $.19 per pound.\"\n\nShe and I walked outside to the front of the store.  Sure enough, big boxes filled with what I guess are \"little pumpkins\" and a big sign that says $.19 per pound.  No other signs, no special wording about \"big\" and \"small\" pumpkins. \n\nShe actually said: \"You're right.  Let me talk to my manager.\"\n\nA few minutes later, the manager comes over and asserts that the pumpkins we selected were $.79 per pound.  I expressed my dismay at the pricing listed and the deceptive way they were doing business.  He stood firm, insisting upon having one sign posted near the produce, but charging a totally different price that is more than 400% more than the listed price.\n\nSo we told them \"no thanks\" and I told the manager that he should change the sign immediately.  We left with a bad taste in our mouth for the way Stanley's does business, the way they treat their customers, and their willingness to lie to my face.\n\nI can only wonder how many other customers didn't pay attention to what the register rang up and paid over 400% than what they thought they were going to pay.  I wonder how many other items in their store are labeled with one price, and ring up with another price.  I wonder what else the manager at Stanley's is doing to surreptitiously increase prices by 400%.\n\nI'll not be returning to Stanley's ever again.\n\nAlong with this review, I'm also in touch with the Chicago Department of Business Affairs & Consumer Protection.",

But we passed by Stanley's way after closing the other night and I happened to be in the area again today.\n\nBeautiful \"organic\" California peaches for 98\u00a2/lb. That's a great price! Also bought cauliflower (49\u00a2/lb.), green beans (59\u00a2/lb.), and end-of-season bing cherries ($1.98/lb.; $1/lb. less than elsewhere!). The review at http://chicagoist.com/2005/05/24/stanleys_fruit_vegetables.php  is way over the top. \n\nClean and great looking, fresh produce. Lots of bright, shiny people here though, and free parking. One discovery near their deli, Jiminy freshly cooked chips (potato, sweet potato, pita, tortilla, etc., at premium prices) - http://www.jiminychips.com/",

(My weekly Stanley's haul is normally under $5 for a weeks worth of veg.)\n- Great organic selection.\n- The fruit is occasionally quite ripe (strawberries, avocados) so use things like that right away or they will spoil.\n- The parking lot can get a little \"Mad Max\".

Why is it I never see those delicious [enter produce name] until I'm already at the register? I totally would have gotten some [re-enter produce name] if it hadn't been hidden by that shelf!\n\nWhat Stanley's lacks in freshness, bee tee dubya, they totally make up for in price (2). I'm really not sure how they do it. I once saw whole watermelons on sale here for 50 cents. Not 50 cents a pound, we're talkin the whole mel\u00f3n. HOWEVER, no matter how inexpensive everything may be don't go stocking up -- a lot of their produce tends to go bad rather quickly (3).

It's cheaper and better than Jewel, Dominick's, etc. \nPart Two: The people who shop at Stanley's are a-holes. I am sure not everyone is, but when I go there I end up being annoyed or injured by someone. It's usually an upscale looking, older white woman who  runs into me with her cart and does not apologize. A cart running into your ankle is a lousy way to buy a tomato. I know you have money, but say sorry, I'm not one of your servants. Or some idiot in a giant SUV who cuts me off in the parking lot. I just want to fight and kill after these little incidents... but I got some cheap veges, so instead of killing I eat. In a month I'll be back for more.",

Stanley's effects on me are profound: it's easy on the wallet, and it probably prolongs my life :)\n\nYou can load up on goodies for $15-$20 here.  It would probably be twice as much at a chain, or 3x as much at Whole Paycheck :)   Man, I've seen Dominick's and Jewel sell single green peppers for $2 each, wth??   I love just browsing the aisles and finding whatever is cheap and \"in season.\"  One week it may be 10c green peppers, another week it's 49c/lb bok choy.  It always makes your food preparations interesting!  It's like being on Iron Chef...   Yeah some items don't last more than a week or two in the fridge, but you just learn to eat what you buy.\n\nI find that I eat healthier when I shop at Stanley's, because I buy much more fruit and veggies than I would elsewhere.  It's tough having carnivorous tendencies; I blame places like Hot Doug's for enabling them.  Stanley's balances out my diet.  Maybe if I eat enough veggies, all the fat and grease in my system will disappear?  Anyways, I always come back with 3-5 bags of stuff (for under $20!)  So instead of having a twinkie as a snack (lol), it's just as easy to nibble on some broccoli or an apple.  And instead of fries as a side dish, why not steam some spinach or mushrooms?\n\nOh yeah, it is indeed easier to shop at Stanley's on a weekday.",

Not only am I from Iowa, I cook and I care about the quality of my ingredients.  While on my last Stanley's excursion, I did, in fact, come across some spectacular looking finds here.  The strawberries, for example, looked bright red, sweet, and delicious.  The corn even looked fresh and edible.\n\nHowever, I shouldn't dig through almost an entire bin/section of an item to locate something that's fresh and without the beginnings of mold.  That goes for common items like tomatoes and jalape\u00f1os.  I will say that a fair portion of things sold here would be acceptable if you were using it the same day.  For most people, like me, things are left in the crisper for a few days and not much would hold up well for even that short amount of time.\n\nI left with only a few items and ended up back at my local produce market.  I'll stick to that or, in season, farmer's markets, in the future.",

I don't even live near here, but I will find a way when I'm in the area.\n\nI honestly didn't see the rotting produce that other reviewers talked about.  In fact, I thought the quality was pretty good, and this is not my first veggie rodeo.  But, obviously this is only one day, so maybe I got lucky today.  Also, I'm trying not to be as much of a produce snob, because there's SO much waste in the grocery business.  A few blemishes aren't a big deal.  (But like I said, the quality was high today, at least for what I was looking at.)\n\nCHEAP.  OMG cheap.  When the cashier told me my total, I actually laughed.  I'm sure she gets it a lot and/or thought I was a lame yuppy sucker on a field trip.  Whatever, that's cool.  Because OMG CHEAP.  $5.65 for what would have easily cost me $20 at Jewel.\n\nI don't know whether to cry, \"Bless you, Stanley's, for selling shit so cheap,\" or \"Screw you, Jewel, for being so expensive.\"\n\nToday's prices:\n\nAsparagus: $.98 a pound.  Ninety-eight freakin cents.  Jewel is currently selling asparagus of the same quality for $3.99 a pound, and Dominicks had a sale last week for like $2.99 a pound.  Trader Joe's is selling it for like $1.99 a pound, and I thought THAT was a steal.  (I eat a lot of asparagus, obviously lol.)  Total for a regular sized bunch: $1.03 + tax.\n\nBaking potatoes: $.49 a pound.  I only got two, because they were monster sized.  $.99 + tax.\n\nGolden Delicious apples: $.98 a pound.  Usually like $1.29 a pound at Jewel.  These were pretty small, though.  I like the big assed nuclear ones.\n\nGrape tomatoes: $.98 for a small box.  Are you for serious?  These are like at least $2.99 at the regular grocery store, sometimes more.\n\nRed bell pepper: $.69 a pound.  Whoa.  Like whoa.  I've sometimes seen a SINGLE red pepper for like $2.  This one cost me $.33 + tax.\n\nOrange bell pepper: $.98 a pound.  Huzzah!\n\nBananas: $.69 a pound.  Actually, Trader Joe's is really the place to buy bananas if you're there ($.19 each), but still.  I got 4 bananas at Stanley's for a grand total of $1.14 + tax.\n\nYes, I realize it's kind of wackadoo of me to type out all the prices, but seriously.  It's that amazeballs!\n\nMy only complaint...watch out for meandering hipsters and stubborn old ladies who obviously hate that the store has been discovered by meandering hipsters.  This one old lady seriously just stepped in front of me in line at the register.  Just walked straight up and stood in front of me and shoved her one apple and her dollar bill at the cashier.  This was not confusion.  This was balls.  So yeah.  Ballsy old ladies who don't give a fuck.  But you kind of have to love that, so whatevs.",

The market itself is small but clean and incredibly well-stocked. Everything is super-cheap... 10 for $1 is a constant theme throughout and the Oxnard strawberries I live close enough to pick up directly from the field yet still run me at least $3/pound here in Cali only cost $1/pound somehow at Stanley's. We did some serious damage, buying limes, lemons, corn, strawberries, potatoes, watermelon, etc. for a bbq for 70 people. All that combined with 2 snooty juice drinks from the cooler which made up $6 of our bill and yet somehow it was only $25 out the door! So yeah, I have some serious produce market envy, Stanley's.

Then, the strawberries and corn caught my eye. So, I decided that I had to stop.\n\nBeing from Iowa, I am super picky about corn. The corn manager said that it was fresh from Florida but still, I couldn't do it. I'll wait for my parents to deliver sweet corn to me in a few months.\n\nI grabbed a few pounds of strawberries (and I don't even like strawberries) and they were super. Perfectly ripe, sweet, juicy. I loved 'em. \n\nI grabbed a cantaloupe too! This is the REAL reason why I came out of hiding. I ate half the cantaloupe today for lunch because I couldn't stop! It was SO juicy and delicious. My pants got soaked from the cantaloupe juice while I was eating it but I didn't care, I just kept noshing. \n\nI also grabbed a bunch of ingredients to make a Greek salad (which I have been eating on for 5 days) and all the veggies were fresh and delicious. I cannot say enough good things about this place. I'm usually an Aldis-junkie for veggies but Stanley's will be my store of choice from now on.

Jewel and Dominicks sell produce that lasts forever because it's like plastic - unless you are buying organic, it seems as far away from a freshly farmed vegetable that you can get.\n\nBut alas, although Stanley's has a good selection of fresh produce and is wonderfully priced, I am lucky enough to be a suburbanite and live in between 3 Caputo's Markets.  And Caputo's blows Stanley's away - thus the 3.5 stars for Stanley's.  For a produce place, their selection and variety of produce is about 60% of what you can get at Caputo's; and Caputo's is inexpensive as well.  And Caputo's carries deli, and canned ethic goods - so I can get most of my shopping done there.   So, city dwellers, Stanley's is a great option for you, and if you are currently shopping at a big box, I would advise you to try out Stanleys one of these days.  Otherwise, I'll stick with my Caputo's.",

Buy potatoes, beets, carrots, celery root, hard squash and other root veg with abandon -- this stuff is gobs cheaper than at other markets, and can kick around your refrigerator's crisper drawer for a while. \n\nMore perishable fruits and veg you've got to approach cautiously. Take peaches, for example. Squeeze 'em. If they're firm, you've got some time to let them lounge around your countertops. If they're really soft, you've got to eat them right away. Or make ice cream, or cobbler, or jam. Same goes for tomatoes -- make pizza sauce, or salsa, or a huge tomato-onion salad, but don't buy six pounds, leave them on your counter for a week, then complain when they go bad. \n\nI love Stanley's for the novelty -- it's always different. Makes shopping with a list difficult, but if you're relatively flexible or adventurous, it's great. I hit up the organic side of the store first -- the selection's a little smaller, but the prices are almost always better than the conventional stuff. Plus it's less crowded, so leave your cart over there [tucked neatly aside, of course] while you wander the rest of the store.\n\nI also dig the dry goods section -- Intelligentsia coffee and tea, great ethnic breads, dried pastas, killer tortilla chips, and lots of little weirdo snacky nuts and treats.

The berries are a great example of flavorlessness.  Perhaps some of their produce is decent and you just have to search it out.  I, however, have neither the time nor the patience to hunt down the perfect tomato.  On the up side, it's cheap.  I suppose you get what you pay for.    \n\nThey've got some okay non-produce items, but for a spot that has \"Fruit & Vegetables\" right in the name, they ought to step up their game.\n\nOh, and another thing:  people have tried to tell me that all of Stanley's produce is organic.  It is not.  Read the signs.  Organic produce is marked as such.",

Outstanding selection is sometimes marred by underripe or overly ripe produce, so just look closely before you fill up your little plastic baggy. Good organic selection; if you're like me and not married to organic food but will buy it if the price is right, check out their organic stuff before selecting the non-organic- occasionally the organic stuff is a little cheaper. There are a few other special buys they get here, like toothbrushes, taco chips, and olive oil. The dairy section has some great yogurt that's pretty cheap compared to supermarket prices.\n\nEDIT: The last few times I've been here, I've been pretty aggravated about the way that a few of their workers sweep the floors. This may sound nitpicky, but if you've seen them do it you'll know what I mean. These guys have a broom in their hand and aggressively sweep all the junk across the floor to some corner to be picked up. The problem is, they have no aim and no consideration for customers that are walking the aisles. Don't be surprised if you're shopping here and get hit in the feet or legs with pieces of spinach, green beans, peanut shells, or onion peelings. If I'm in shorts and/or flip flops, I especially don't want to get hit by that junk.",

You have to really look over the produce and be careful to not buy a ton because it will turn bad within a week.  That is certainly worth the cost of this place.

I stand by my Yelp rating of 4 stars because this place truly saves my checkbook. I haven't had any problems with food going bad any sooner than produce purchased at other grocery stores and I feel better buying here since it goes back to organic and local farmers.\r\n\r\nThe deals they have at Stanley's are out of this world great on items in surplus. Sometimes a Stanley's trip will define what I decide to make. If avocados are super cheap, then guacamole will be made. Some of the items that they do carry are catered more towards the yuppie clientele, but the reason they stock premium cheese and yogurt is likely because helps them sell the produce at such a low cost. This past weekend we grilled sweet corn from Stanley's twice and both times; just excellent and they were 5 for a dollar. What would a dollar get you at a chain grocery store and what chemicals had it likely been processed through? I love Stanley's!",

Since going vegetarian, this has been my spot for everything that has kept me healthy, and full of energy.\n\nI go here at least once a week, and have never spent more than $40 for ridiculous amounts of fresh fruit and vegetables.  It really is hard to spend a lot of money here.  It seems like they have grapefruit year-around, great selection of apples and pears (my favorites to snack on), as well as a good organic selection.\n\nThey have fresh basil, parsley, cilantro and other spices, any and everything you need to make your favorite salsas, sauces, hummus and soups.\n\nI'm weird.  I think about how I would get by if I were homeless.  Well this is the place I'd get the most bang for whatever buck I could get.  Five bucks would feed me for the week if I did it right!  Is it bad for me to think like that?\n\nAnyways, if you're going to drive to Dominick's or Jewel, take the extra 5 minutes, go to Stanley's and you'll end up buying more for less, and eating healthier.",

Learn how to buy it!  If you don't plan on eating all your bananas the day after you buy them, don't buy all ripe bananas!  Is it really that hard?\n\nI've shopped at Stanley's for about five years now, typically making semi-monthly trips.  Granted, I eat like a vegan who likes bacon, but I've rarely had any of their produce go bad on me prematurely.  Even the pre-cut mesclun green mix has lasted well over a week in my fridge, and the Jewel version I've bought on occassion barely lasts two days before wilting into something I won't even touch.\n\nBefore you complain about the \"quality\" of Stanley's produce, learn how to look for what will keep!  It's the same as any neighborhood produce market, only it's filled with hip idiots nowadays.  Buy a ripe avocado, buy a hard avocado.  Buy a ripe banana, buy a green banana.  Buy a bright red apple, buy an apple that's still a little green.  It's not that hard.  Keep your eyes open and you can save a bundle, eat for virtually nil, and bear witness to some hilarious conversations about Chicago's culture from people who grew up in Niles.",

The produce is cheap and should be eaten within a few days. Most of the greens will wilt badly two or three days after you bring them home: SO EAT THEM FAST. \n\nTHE WORST PART about this place are the blockhead customers that feel the need to put everything in plastic bags and then get more plastic bags to put those bags into. Today I saw a man put three potatoes into plastic bags and then check out to put that bag into another bag. Dude, potatoes are grown in dirt - the dirtiest of things. You don't need two plastic bags for something that you're most likely going to wash when you get home anyway.

The lighting in that place is stellar. The produce -- excellent. Sexcellent even. Great price, it's all fresh and that's basically all you need to hear. Because you and I both know that the produce at Jewel ain't cutting it. And lord knows buying produce at Super Target on Elston doesn't feel right. Stanley's is da bomb.\n\nThey also sell delicious Italian groceries such as my favorite pasta and italian soda.

They have everything neatly put away, and all the shelves are fully stocked. There staff is also very friendly, I asked a nice young man where I could locate the yellow squash, he responded...\"Oh unfortunately we don't carry yellow squash currently. I'm sorry--we do have some butternut or spaghetti!\" How nice was that? They also are cheap. Everything I got (and I received a lot) was under $20.00. They also carry some quick snack like food if you'd like such as hummus, dips, yogurts & cheese.\n\nThe Bad & the Ugly: Some of their produce was bruised--badly. I had to dig underneath the bad bananas to get to the bit unripe ones for about 5 minutes. The bananas on the top were so black that they were meant of banana bread, not snacking. Also a lot of their red onions didn't look so good. So I had to get Spanish onions instead. The berry section didn't look promising either. \n\nSo this place is really a toss up. I'll keep going here for random groceries. But not shop here totally. Cermak Produce has the best produce around my hood anyway.",

Most of the produce is quality, but occasionally you'll be like, \"Oh, SWEET, ten plums for a dollar!\" and then find out that you have roughly 13 hours until they wither and sprout a toxic-looking white mold.\n\nDefinitely one of the cheapest places in the city for fruits and vegetables, and why has no one mentioned the piped-in '80s music that's always playing? Where else can you squeeze eggplants while singing along to ABC's \"(Shoot That) Poison Arrow\"?",

            "description": "Makes it easy to eat GREEN\n\nUPDATE: 2/2008 - Retracting the lettuce improvement update.  Inconsistent.  \n\nYou like-a da fruit?  Well, don't do an Italian accent here because the guy who owns the place is Greek.  \n\nWHAT THEY HAVE - Fresh veggies, fruits and herbs (organic and not), plus pastas, cheeses, breads, dairy, eggs, olive oil, olives, nuts.  No meat.\n\nWHATS GOOD - Basics like broccoli, mushrooms, zuchini, eggplant, red & green peppers, cruciferous stuff, salad (like baby spinach, mesclum, arugula, etc.), herbs (when available).  Belgian endive (which is SUPER expensive everywhere else) is very reasonable.  Try the funky greens like Swiss chard or rapini (treat like spinach or broccoli, respectively).  \n\nWHATS HIT OR MISS - You have to go on a weekly basis.  I give the place 4 stars only because sometimes you find stuff that is not in season, and shouldn't be there.  Or it is in season, and it is SPECTACULAR (huges heads of frise, escarole; incredible plums, peaches, cherries melons, etc.).  They are working on it, but romaine, greenleaf or redleaf lettuce is typically hit or miss (mostly miss).  \n\nHOW'S THE OTHER STUFF -  Bread - carb heaven.  Pasta - just fine.  Dairy - all good.  Nuts, olives, and olive oil - reasonable and tasty. \n\nPRICES - EXCELLENT.  If you compare to J or D on the scale, they are always below.  Now expensive stuff like fennel is about the same, but how often do you eat fennel?\n\nPARKING - Street or lot\n\nCAVEATS - Fruits like grapes or cherries are available and good while in season, but off season, you have to try them (i.e. sample a grape, or take only 1 apple, plum, etc, and try at home).  Same with apples from Argentina, citrus from Ecuador, etc.  Remember, anything that comes off a boat came off the tree GREEN and was artificially ripened.  Stick with as much local stuff as you can. \n\nIf you like veggies like we like veggies, go here FIRST.  If you can't find it, it's probably not in season.",

They also had strawberries here - 3 packages for $2, otherwise they were $79 for a package.  Vine tomatoes were 10 cents each!  They even have a few additonal extra ethnic items and spices sold here.  The workers always seem to keep all the items stocked.  They do need more carts because it can get pretty busy in here.  They also have free parking.  I'm definitely coming here again for my fruits and veggies.  See this makes cooking worthwhile when it all adds up to become less expensive than going out to eat!",

Flashback a few hours to Christmas Eve 2011 at 5 PM. I'm a Jew at home alone finally getting the energy to go out and buy the necessary accoutrements to take to a friend's Christmas the next day. It finally occurs to me; everything might not be open. I call my beloved Stanley's to ask if they are - and lo and behold I'm told they'll be selling me produce until 7 PM! I rush out the door (ok I mosey out the door at 6 PM) because I do NOT want to be the jerk there at 6:59 ruining everyone's lives. I'm there by 6:15. I get all my fruits and veggies, and run over to the meat counter to grab some pancetta (sue me, I like to eat my veggies with pork on Christian holidays). I dodge the woman madly mopping and the guy wiping things and stand by the deli counter. There's someone behind the counter doing...something, so I stand there patiently waiting. It's a full minute. Finally the woman mopping (who by the way has seen me and walked around me several times) finally says \"we're closed\". I was confused and said \"Oh no! I'm so sorry, I thought you closed at 7 PM\" to which she replied \"yes, that's right\". I was confused, like maybe I had missed the mid December extra daylight savings time? I said \"It's only 6:20\" and she replied \"Right, we close at 7 so if we want to leave at 7 everything has to be clean by then, so we start now.\" I stood there for a while. It's Christmas, I get it, you want to get home to your families. I used to work at a hotel; those are 24/7/365! There's no closing early for holidays. It sometimes sucks, but that's the way it is. I argued for a minute, and said closing at 7 means that's when they stopping serving customers, but she disagreed once more and said they had to have everything cleaned up. So I left. No one on my way out asked me how everything was or if I found everything I wanted or I probably would have shared my crappy experience. \n\nI'll be back. It's Stanley's, and you can't beat their prices, but it's such a shame for a place to rest on its laurels or perhaps not provide top notch service because they know I have very few fabulous and cheap produce shopping options in the vicinity. \n\nSigned,\n\nScrooge",

I was pissed about the couch and slightly aroused all at the same time.\n\nThey have parking, the woman who shop in there are phenomenal (what a meat market in a fruit stand), and the prices are awesome.

Whenever I'm riding a bus past Stanley's I wince because of my fond memories for those days when 49 cents was all I had to pay for a pound of tomatoes. Now, I wouldn't buy a pound of tomatoes from Stanley's unless I was planning on using them immediately because most of their produce is sold ripe. Being ripe, it's at its peak and that you should eat it within a few days or it will spoil. Now, that's not the case with everything they sell (I have brussell sprouts in my refrigerator that I bought last week that are still green), but it does seem to be a general rule.\n\nAlso, the non-fruit or non-produce section is very sparse, but also eccentric. You can get kidney beans in a french language label, jalapeno hummus, and tea from intelligentsia. It's like the thrift store of groceries where you have to pick over the racks to make sure you don't buy a shirt (plum) with stains (bruises).",

They've got local bread - with only four ingredients. Did you hear me people? FOUR. That's how many ingredients bread SHOULD have. Read the back of your sandwich bread when you get home, and then run out to Stanley's and buy some of the Ciabatta. Four ingredients. I could weep - but then, I'm a total loser for real bread.\n\nIt's well-lit, friendly, stocked to the rafters, and yes - there is a guy with a potato-chip making machine thing.

I've been driving far out west to pick up my fruits and veggies, thinking that it's the closest place around that wasn't a major grocer.  \n\nSo one day I decided to search yelp for a fruit market and tadaaa.... there's one soooooo close by (a hop, skip and a jump away!)!  It's my favorite place to go now and it is definitely helping me out w/ my goal of cutting back on meat consumption.  True, some of the produce doesn't look like it would last long, but real penny pinchers know that the best way to take advantage of the prices there are to chop up the goods and freeze them for later use so that they last longer.  Then again, there are plenty of produce that are sold in excellent condition there.\n\nI love how I can fill up my own bottle of olive oil.  I tried the basil olive oil last weekend and it's so flavorful!  I also love how there's such a huge selection of portobello mushrooms vs. the small prepackaged ones that are found in the other stores I've seen.     Caged eggs are so filled w/ crap these days that I can't eat them w/o having an upset stomach and I was sooooooo impressed that Stanley's only carried cageless eggs and for so much cheaper!

Awesome!\n\nWhen you walk in, go to the left for organic, straight for the regular stuff, and right for breads/nuts. There is something for everyone. I like to take advantage of the herb-infused oils (back-middle), fresh packaged herbs (back left case), and the great daily specials (displayed out front in the summer. \n\nThis is all around a great deal. The fruit actually has a distinctive flavor. Imagine that! I definitely prefer to shop here for cost, quality, and a great variety. I have been introduced to so many different items like apple pears. Yummy!\n\nStanley's gets 5 stars from me because on too rare an occasion they have MILK & HONEY GRANOLA. It is the SH*T!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

Monstrous peppers and sweet potatoes for what seems like pennies.  Also the selection is ten times that of our Jewel.  \n\nI HIGHLY recommend the spinach.\n\nOne downside: don't get any breads there.  We got some focaccia that went bad the next day.",

At first I was attracted to your isles and isles of produce and awed by your very VERY cheap prices, but I have seen the truth and am a fool no more.  \n\nYour prices are cheap because you ARE cheap and I now understand I  only get what i pay for.  Your fruits and veggies are just SO INCONSISTENT. I never know if it's going to be good or bad. And when you're bad, you're oh so bad. \n\nYour prices can never make up for the disappointment from  a mealy apple or a flavorless orange.\n\nWe can still be friends, but this love affair is over.",

I'm sold.\n\nThe selection is awesome.  There's a wide range of greens, fruits, root vegetables, herbs...you name it.  A lot of them are also organic, which is a definite plus.  The only gripe I have is that I really do get what I pay for.  Some produce seems too good to be true - which it is.  After the first day, I can find some of the stuff rotting away.

I got at least 6 good size zuchs for my three recipes (and had WAY too much left over) but this was some of the freshest, tastiest zuchinni I have EV-ER had! Also got a boat load of other fresh fruits and veggies and all of it was under $25! Are you freaking kidding me?? Sah-wheat!! \n\nI have to say the great find of the day was the Chip Guy in the back of Stanley's (by the deli counter). Holy Sweet Potates! These are good chips! The sweet potato chips rock!

Stanley's has come to your rescue and saved you from having to stoop to a ramen-only diet!\n\nWhere else can you get 10 kiwis for $1, 10 red peppers for $0.69, zucchini and yellow squash practically free, 2 honeydew melons for $1, 1 quart of organic strawberries for $0.25, 1 pint of organic raspberries for $0.50 or a pound of organic grapes for $1?  One of my personal faves are the spring greens and baby spinach that are $3 per POUND which is a whole lot when you're talking about how little those things actually weigh.  I might also mention they sell good quality olive oil infused with herbs on the cheap and you can even bring in your own bottles to re-use.  There's no other way around it:  Stanley's is the cat's pajamas!\n\nSeriously: Stanley's makes it financially plausible for me to eat healthfully and that is a wonderful thing.  This place is wonderful and it's the closest I'll ever come to fresh veggies now that I live in the city and my backyard is 5x5.  If you're anything like me you'll get too excited that everything is so cheap and actually buy the 10lbs of squash and 4 quarts of strawberries and expect that you can eat it all before it spoils which prob. won't happen.  The good news is that you're only out like $0.17 so everyone wins!",

Sometimes fruits or veggies are kinda old and rot within a day or so. So you have to be careful. .On occassion they have pineapple without any husks and it's taken off in front of you outside. MMMM tons of pineapple. \n\nAnd sometimes they have very crazy prices like 5 dollar for a CASE of strawberries. \nSpring greens are really reasonable and way less expensive. And you can pick through it and make sure that it's not nasty and rotten.\nyey\n\nThere are organic produce and also the non organic. \nBoth cheaper then whole foods or jewel or dominick's. \nI'm so glad I found this place.

Stanley's is mostly produce with a large selection of organic and conventional with AWESOME prices. Sometimes organic is the same price as conventional! They also have a section of pastas, breads, rice, tomato sauces/salsas, etc. They also carry dairy products and have a deli as well. I love this place because its small they don't sell any processed junk that would be tempting to buy! I would give 5 stars but the only downside is that their stock of things is always changing, sometimes they have their awesome guacamole available and sometimes they don't. I suggest shopping there often to take full advantage of their changing deals and sales. For those who take the CTA: bus 72 stops at Elston right in front of Stanley's making it super convenient.",

Stanleys\n3. Dominicks\n4.Famers market\n5.Jewell\n\nDont blame me if you live past lincoln park cause i am sure you have way better produce. But for this side of town for the price its the best we can get. Unless you can afford to pay 5 dollars for one peach at wholefoods, this is your spot for good cucs, herbs, apples what els one needs in life??",

The first time I shopped I had to ask another shopper if I was reading the signs correctly - \"Garlic cloves 10/$1.00!?!\"  The produce is good, but some things you need to use very quickly, particularly berries.  I've had other things last quite some time - I guess it's the luck of the draw.  \n\nThey also have nice fresh-baked breads, spices, a small dried fruit/nut selection, a dairy cooler with a selection of ethnic foods like tabbouli and hummus, and a deli.  They also have a guy that makes fresh sea salt and sweet potato chips right there and gives out samples!  They are so yummy, but expensive ($4 per bag).\n\nThe employees could certainly be more friendly, but when I'm getting such a great deal I don't much mind not being smiled at.",

Plus huge jugs of olive oil you can bottle yourself, a standard dairy section, and a smattering of other food items (tinned tomatoes, cookies, dried pasta). Keep your eye on the sales--10-cent limes, lemons, and heads of garlic can't be beat, but apples for $2 a pound work out to a buck each, yikes. Much of the produce is already ripe, edging toward overripe: remember to squeeze your tomatoes in the store so you don't bitch about them being bruised once they get home (man, that could be my motto for so many areas of life). \n\nThe quality can't compete with farmers' markets--you'll still be munching on the same waxy, mealy fruits you find in other grocery stores--but the prices are much easier to swallow.

The organic products that they have aside from fruits and vegetables (like milk, for example) are a little more expensive than I've found them elsewhere.\n\nStanley's is kind of hit-or-miss. I waited for them to have bell peppers for months, and was glad to find them last time I went. Two downsides should be noted:\n\n1. The food doesn't last long. I got the best looking carton of strawberries I could get the last time I went, and they went bad within three days or so. To their glory, though, those were honestly the best strawberries I've ever had in my life. They were so juicy and full of flavor. \n2. I've found better tasting fruit at Trader Joe's. They have a large apple section, but Trader Joe's taste better and are comparable, if not a little cheaper, in regard to quantity. Like I said, very hit-or-miss!\n\nEither way, I would recommend checking it out if you're by North Ave. and are always looking for ways to eat healthy and save money on groceries.",

Although it's not always the best it is still hit more than miss; I am giving them four stars after all.  I never leave disappointed by the time I consider all my purchases and my bill.\nIn addition the staff is very friendly.  I have yet, in my 100 trips, failed to receive a friendly smile at the checkout.

I've been noticing lately that if you don't eat your buys within a few days they'll rot or wilt more quickly than if I buy such things as Raspberries or Salad Mix from Jewel or the D. \n\nThere are other pluses such as the deli which seems to have a great selection. \n\nAll in all, I will remain a dedicated shopper of Stanley's but I will definitely be spending more time inspecting my fruits and veggies for ripeness. \n\nAlso, don't go on the weekend as a first timer. If you do, don't get a cart. Use a re-usable bag or basket. I've actually seen a yelling match between two Lincoln Park yuppies because of inept cart pushing/parking abilities. At first it was hysterical and then it turned ugly.",

However, after 1 visit, she was even more excited than I was.  \n\nAfter reading some of the other reviews, I was a little nervous about my produce having a shorter shelf-life and put off reviewing until I had been a regular repeat customer.  Stanley's is now part of my weekly or bi-weekly grocery run.  The little bit of extra gas to get here is far outweighed by how much money I save.  It's all produce and the prices are amazing.  The last time I went, I got cartons of raspberries for $0.69 each!  And they lasted 2 weeks!  I buy all of my produce here and can finally afford to buy organic when I want to!  (Sometimes organic fruit here is cheaper than regular fruit at Jewel...awesome)  I rarely spend more than $10.  (last week I spent $6.47 on everything)  \n \nNow, nobody is perfect and Stanley is no exception.  When buying produce here, I rarely come with a list, but do have my staples in mind.  This is a place where you buy what looks good and what is in season--how you should shop anyway.  If something doesn't look good that week, I don't get it and look again next week.  \n\nI will continue to be a repeat customer at this year-round, open late, farmers market kind of place.",

After that luxury, it's been really hard going to Trader Joe's or Jewel week after week, paying wayyy too much money, and still only going home with a bag of apples and some pears.\n\nBut after consulting Yelp, I tried Stanley's last night.  I walked in and my jaw dropped.  So much produce, and rock-bottom prices.  They even had \"exotic\" fruit, and a few things I've never even heard of.\n\nAfter reading the other Yelp reviews, I was fully prepared to comb through bins of overripe produce and just grab enough for dinner that night.  But with the exception of the tomatoes and tomatilloes, most of the produce was just fine.  Who knows, maybe they'd just gotten their shipment in,  or maybe Stanley's has gotten better since those other reviews were posted?  Regardless, I left there with 4 bags of produce that should last me the week, for a fraction of what I would have paid elsewhere.\n\nAnd the best part?  Olive and Deli Pickle bar!  \n\nDefinitely going back.",

Stanley himself is a cool guy and you see him walk around juggling fruit and kicking plastic bags around the floor.\n\nThe best thing this place has going for it (Except for the watermelon airplane sign. I want that thing for my apartment.) is that it's cheap. You can't really ask for much more in a fruit market except for more variety.",

If you don't cook for a lot of people, however, be careful not to go too crazy, or else you'll end up with much of it rotting in your fridge. Ideally there would be one of these in every neighborhood like NYC, where you can stop by every few days. The prices are very inconsistent. For example, I love blueberries, and there's like a 2 week window in July when you can get them as cheap as $1 a pint. However, just a week later, they went up to $5 a pint. That's just crazy. I wasted a trip when I could have gone to a grocery store.",

I was in an absolute panic late Sunday night and after emptying every bag and pocket,turning the car inside out, the house upside down and even going through the garbage, we could only think that I must have dropped it at Stanley's. After a sleepless night in Chicago, I put a call into Stanley's at 6:00 AM--that's when they open! They said to call back at 9:30 when the woman who would have that information would be in. I called at that time, and voila! Even when they aren't rescuing unconscious shoppers, the ladies are sweet tempered and polite, but, I had to sing their praises especially in light of my recent experience. I will always remember to be courteous to them and next time, I go in,I will take them some flowers or chocolates  because they wouldn't even take a reward!",

I couldn't even decide what fruits I wanted to get, they had such an immense selection. You can't beat these prices! Suuuuper cheap and you can get sooo much! I eat a piece of fruit every single day and this place works for me. They also make their own chips. I was checking the place out, saw their bags of chips and really didn't think much of it...until I saw their huge 'chip-making apparatus'! And they give u samples! They're pretty good but all I really wanted was fruits. Ended up getting some apples, pears and strawberries...just for $5! And I got enough for 2 weeks. Pretty amazing! See you in two weeks, my love! ^_^",

Last time I went they had large glass containers with different flavored infused olive oils, you could fill containers they provide you with any flavor you want. \nI see the reviews of rotten veggies but not once in the 20+ times that I've been there have I gotten rotten veggies or fruit. The produce is straight from the farm though, so some people might not be used to that, especially in the city where fruits and veggies are irradiated and last for an abnormal amount of time before you need to use them.\nOverall-fantastic prices, I'm a vegetarian and I can buy 2 weeks worth of recipes for under $30.",

Seriously, most of the non-organic fruit and veg was just nasty looking, and not at that great of a price, either. The organic stuff certainly looked fresher, but not by much. The items at the deli were some sort of name brand, and looked fine, but totally overpriced.\n\nI shouldn't be telling you all this because it's packed enough as it is, but head to Harvestime on Lawrence - good prices and spectacular produce, and their deli is reasonably priced. Once you try Harvestime, you won't go back to Stanley's, trust me.",

It is really difficult to spend more than $40 bucks here even if I fill my basket to overflowing and the produce selection includes a pretty fair amount of organics since they expanded/remodeled.  \n\nIt is true that some of the produce won't last longer than a couple of days, so you may want to plan ahead for that.  However, for a fraction of the price of whole foods, it is well worth the risk of the occasional throw away.  Plus a decent selection of bread, nuts, eggs and dairy, I can often go weeks without having to go to a mega-supermarket by making a few quick stops into Stanleys.",

Even at the high end places like Fox & Obels and Whole Foods I have a difficult time finding an unblemished apple. \n\nUnfortunately, this place totally skived me out.  With a handful of exceptions, the produce was visibly rotting or covered with mold.  I still managed to find a few non-tainted items, but they only lasted a few days in the fridge. Even the garlic was rotting in less than a week, I have NEVER seen garlic rot.\n\nThis produce can't be healthy, and it is definitely not fresh.

            "description": "Stanley's is pretty bad.  I used to think they were great, but like a couple others here, I've grown sick and tired of walking in there and almost gagging at how horrible the produce looks.  The produce I buy at my corner no-name market lasts longer than Stanley's.  One time I took a package of strawberries back the next day because they were prematurely going bad, and the manager at Stanley's (who looked like a greasy coke fiend) first looked at me like I was crazy, then begrudgingly authorized the return.  I keep thinking, what if more people did that...spoke up about how bad some of their fruit/vegs are, but nooo, that's their whole business strategy--banking on selling the cheapest dumpster-dived shit and knowing that no will inconvenience themselves enough to return it.  I realize the stuff is being sold for cheap because it is about to turn, but I've taken my business elsewhere and have found produce just as cheap that is NOT about to turn.  \n\nThis is a mixed review, because I still shop there sometimes--you have to buy what you want to eat that day to get the most out of Stanley's.  I use Stanley's well when I plan a dinner party and I'm making the rounds getting what I need for THAT NIGHT...its usually cheap and good enough.  But if you are trying to buy your week's groceries and want to take advantage of the prices (most are very cheap) than good luck, its not worth the money you save because most of the food you bring home will not last the week.\n\nI have to say, its really hard finding one store that has everything under one roof.  One place I like is on the corner of Devon and Talman, the produce is excellent, as cheap as Stanley's (but fresh) AND they have a full service deli with 6 kinds of feta (French feta is amazing), olives, good lunchmeat, not to mention the whole Indian element, i.e. frozen samosas, dal makhani in a box, wholesale spices, etc, plus Swiss chocolate, Italian cookies, Flax Plus cereal, Kefir, almost everything I used to have to go to two or three stores to get under one roof.\n\n2008 update: I recently have been shopping at Oakton Marketplace in Skokie...I know its a hike, but they also are really balanced in terms of different kinds of food, and have great produce.  The difference with this place is, they have a parking lot (Devon doesn't) and the aisles are wider.\n\n2010 Update - \nI am never going to Stanley's again.  They have lost control.  Last time I decided to shop there to save a few bucks I was so saddened at the shit they were selling and almost screamed out loud \"is there ANYTHING in this store that's not ROTTING?!\"  I practically got a fungal infection from handling the pineapple - after inspecting a couple I noticed that they all had a moldy film, and my hands smelled wierd.  I went there to get some cauliflower and guess what, every single one of the heads of cauliflower were rotting.  Ditto for the asparagus.  And the strawberries.  I literally had to go to another store to get half the stuff on my list.  The oranges and grapefruit I unfortunately did end up buying turned out to be either dry and nasty or rotten and mushy when I attempted to eat them.  Why bother ever coming here again?  I know I can choose other places (and I have), but part of me also thinks the owner of this store is morally deficient.  I can't imagine how someone could bring the death-laden food Stanleys sells into their store and sell it and feel proud of themselves.\n\nIf you want cheap produce sold by people who care about food and care about quality, our newest favorite is Caputo's at Harlem and Grand.  Its a really awesome all-around store.",

            "description": "Today, I discovered the splendor of Stanley's.  Unemployed, slowly going broke from buying produce at Green City Farmer's Market, finding myself surreptitiously lifting the soft plums out of the trash bin at Treasure Island (tentatively exploring freeganism), I realized my grocery life needed a change.  Stanley's is that change.  They have tons of organic and though many people have complained of quality, I found it to be more than satisfactory for my needs.  Wide-eyed and joining the ranks of frantic bumper cart shoppers, I felt I'd been initiated into a secret club. When the tab came up, I dropped my jaw because I expected my giant cartful of goods to cost much more.  Shopping here saved me tons of money I don't have and is a good choice for the conscientious but impoverished  (i.e. student or recent college grad) who can't afford the exorbitant prices at Whole Foods.",

You do have to use the stuff you buy within a few days because it is ripe, but that's ok in my book.  In terms of the fellow who said he was disappointed in the lettuce selection;  they give you a pound of lettuce for 2.69, and while it might go bad in 2-3 days, you still pay a dollar more for a quarter of the weight at a regular grocery store.  I tend to buy spinach, and when it  starts to get a little soft, i cook it and put it in an omelet or with dinner!",

The produce was always great and of course you can't beat the deals that everyone else has written about below. \n\nHowever, LATELY i will say that Stanley's quality of produce has greatly declined. The Strawberries for a $1... rotten, the onions... rotten. \nAnd the worst purchase from Stanleys lately.... SUN DRIED TOMATOES \nafter eating half of the package (which is packaged by Stanley's) I went to put some on my salad last night when i saw something suspicous in the package. I pulled it out and was DISGUSTED to discover that there in the middle of the STANLEY's sun dried tomatoes was a CIGARETTE BUTT.Packaged in the tomatoes. \n\nI have never been so grossed out... produce no matter how expensive or inexpensive should be FRESH and free of foreign objects. \n\nStanley's is disgusting. I am sad to say that I have bought one too many rotten things from this gross place. \n\nNever going back.",

            "description": "Living within a 5 minute drive from Stanley's makes me love this place much more than when I had to make a huge effort to get there.  Why?  Because this place is based on the fast turnaround.  You will not see the same stuff if you go in there 2 days in a row because they go through such massive amounts of produce.\n\nGreat things about Stanley's:\n1) It's cheap, plain and simple.  After becoming accustomed to their prices, I am insulted to go to Jewel and see what they charge for a non-organic apple.\n2) The staff.  They're all really nice and work really hard at keeping the place stocked and as clean as they can.  I've never seen cashiers clean off their belts or counters anywhere else but here.  Sure the floors are a little dirty but it's gotta be impossible to keep up with the ridiculous amounts of people who come through here.\n3) The specials.  Always some ridiculous deal.  As someone else mentioned, sometimes the stuff on sale seems like it'll be dead in a day, but that's basically why its dirt cheap.  I'll purchase my little avocados for 5/$1 on the chance that some of them are gonna suck.  Still better than the $2 I've seen them at elsewhere.\n4) Random local cheap stuff.  Now I'm not sure how they can sell Natural Ovens bread & bagels for $1-2, but I've never had a bad $1 bag of bagels - I just stick them in the freezer and they keep just fine.  These retail for $4 elsewhere.\n\nBecause I live so close, I'm able to go multiple times per week, unlike others I'm sure.  I do agree that a lot of the stuff doesn't have the same shelf life, but that's why I just buy no more than 4-5 days worth and make it work.   I tend to go after 8pm on weeknights so my trips are quick and painless.\n\nGive Stanley's a try.  Definitely can't hurt.",

I use my juicer/blender everyday and it's awesome for that because everything is at the peak of ripeness there. \n(You can always freeze berries, bananas and greens if you won't eat them in time and then they are ready to be thrown into a cold drink!) \nThey also have free-range eggs and some organic dairy products at a lower price than usual. The spices, cold-cuts, and canned stuff seem to be typical mainstream grocery store quality and are regular price. This is really a store to get your fruits and veggies at for a major bargain.

The check out lanes move very quickly, probably because the have not adapted the \"Self Check Out\" lanes, man those are a trap! There are a lot of organic options open to you as well. I love when I am there and they are stocking up, which seems to happen all the time. Something additional I have noticed lately is the gigantic olive oil jar in the middle of the store where you can sample and pour your own, what a great idea! \n\nAnother great note about this place, Stanley.

Stanley's is the place to go before you cook that special meal you have been dying to try.  There is very limited parking, and it can be crowded if you go during high traffic hours.  I recommend during the day on a weekday if you can manage.  Otherwise, early in the week in the evening has been a good time for me.  The main reason I am giving 4 stars is because the fruit/veggies tend to be at peak condition when you buy them here....so you need to use them right away or they will go bad.  It isn't a huge deal, but it is good to know before you go nuts buying a couple weeks worth of stuff only to have it go bad on you.",

They mainly specialize in fruits and veggies but also have a decent section of breads, deserts (baklava and poundcake!), dried pasta, coffee and tea. And honestly if you can go in and get fresh veggies and fruits and whatever else for 10.00 a week come on, that's just amazing! I do recommend you check out what you buy, when they have those really cheap 10 apples for 1.00 it could be because they are going bad or something...but other then that I have nothing else to say.",

How could you let me pay $2.49/lb for green peppers at Dominick's?  I thought that the produce was insanely overpriced crap in Minneapolis, but Jewel was taking the cake.  \n\nFor the prices at Stanley's, I can fill my Eddie Bauer backpack with a gorgeous, weeksworth array of fruits/veg for about $8-10.  They have a large selection of organic fruits, that are sometimes cheaper than the \"reg\" ones.  They have fresh breads, cheeses, giardinera, and spices.  I don't care if the food may be on the ripe side.  The prices are so incredible that I wouldn't even mind sometimes cutting off the bruisey part.  Without the I-GO, this Noble Square location is about a mile round trip from the El for me, but it is so worth it, that I make a point of going once a week.

My son grabbed $2.98 blueberries (the big container) and my daughter grabbed a big bag of cherries, I took a back of those cute little red champagne grapes, and we headed to get our citrus on! We found Texas grapefruits for .79/lb, Florida navel oranges .98/lb, and Jonathon Michigan apples for .69/lb. The pears we got we .59/lb and the lettuce and spinach you could bag yourself. I was pretty impressed with the cleanliness of the store, no vermin spotted, or fruit flies (I really hate them) would go back in the warm weather though to see if this still holds true. Everything looks good, and kids liked the blueberries and cherries, which barely made it out of the bags, and onto the tables before they went into all the hungry mouths. This being said, I have to admit I have scarfed down more than half a bag of the Jalapeno Jiminy chips....mmmm mmmm good! Love them! Will go back, just for those! I'm going to try their pico de gallo and guacamole, as well as the hummus with roasted garlic. Come on, I spent $38, and my fruit bowl and veggie bins are overflowing with sweet goodness! We never take longer than a couple days to go thru our fruits and veggies anyway, so if something starts to go bad, GREAT! That means we're eating healthy foods! Someone once told me, \"Only eat foods that go bad, but eat them before they do.\" Hmmm...FOOD for thought! Love this place, will be back! Parking was fine, who's afraid of a little walk!? Oh yeah, and extra SNAPS for having cute hanging fruit from the ceiling which entertained and amazed all 3 of my kids, and kept them quiet for about 4 1/2 minutes!",

I totally agree with other posters that you should never buy fruits or berries as they won't last past a day. And never buy any fruit that comes in their plastic containers. As soon as you take it home to wash it, you will find it filled with mold. Total waste of money. And not worth my time to buy it only to find it unedible. I don't have time to grocery shop every day.

Good thing my fridge is on the smaller side...but I've learned my lesson a long time ago about going to town at Stanley's.\n\nThey have been having a special on california navel oranges, so I've been buying a bag full every week.  If you're willing to stand for a few minutes to pick them out, they're pretty tasty.  I think they were 7 for a dollar last week.  I know, I'm shameless.\n\nThe organic bananas didn't taste quite right--not as good as some other places that charge the same price.\n\nOverall, Stanley's is worth the frequent trips for their prices, as long as you remember not to overfill your cart.  And if you're not a produce fiend that's willing to spend at Whole Paycheck.",

So you wanted to get squash and had to settle for zucchini,  there are worse problems.  Besides if you want to go to a place like Stanley's you really should learn how to improvise.

If there was any type of customer service it would probably just about get five but I do not come here for, \"Hi, how are you today\", or \"Bye thanks for coming in\". The produce is inexpensive, like a third to a half of what you would normally spend at grocery stores. There is a good selection of fruits, vegetables, dairy products, some dry goods, and a deli. I will happily pick through bins of produce to find what is good. There are also a lot of other people who do the same, so I just spend a little more time rinsing off at home, the produce, that is. As far as this place being clean? I am kind of a sanitation freak and would not even set foot in the door if I was at all worried. Bottom line...this place has great prices and with a few extra minutes, you can get really good produce.",

If you are purchasing anyting in a container, such as cherry tomatoes, raspberries, strawberries, flip the container over and check how things look at the bottom. Very often the fruit/veggies on the bottom of a container is rotten and moldy. It's really disgusting to get home and pick through a strawberry container only to end up tossing 75% of what's in there due to being moldy and rotten. When fruits and veggies are in bins outside, most often you should stay away from them (with the exception of squash, watermelon, etc..anything that has a \"shell\" seems to be okay). Stay far away from bags of potatoes. Twice I have purchased 10 lb. bags of potatoes to watch them go rotten within a couple days. There's always condensation in the bags...that's an indicator of something wrong. You'll do better by purchasing potatoes by the pound individually. The shelf life of most of what you'll buy here is relatively short. Don't stock up on stuff because in a few days if you haven't consumed it, you will just end up tossing it in the garbage\n\nOn a good note, there's plenty of great, cheap stuff here that is worth the trip! Bananas are cheaper than just about anywhere else in Chicago. In the summer months, the in season fruit is great. Corn on the cob - fantastic! Oranges, apples, peanuts, bread, coffee, spices, a variety of vinegar....all great!",

Watch out for the deli counter.\n\nI asked for slices of a deli meat (and heretofore the service has been excellent, the deli products above average, and the prices awesome)\n\nI see the attendant piling it on the scale. Although she had had to unwrap an entirely new portion of slicing pepperoni, due to Stanley's lack of training, she had elected to start slicing from the small end.\n\nOk - what other product in the case was sliced from the small end?\n\nWhen I said \"I'm not paying for those tiny slices,\" she said \" what am I supposed to do, put them in the garbage? no one else wants them.\"\n\nI was still puzzling the logic of the whole situaton when I looked at the meat in the case and saw that (A) all had small ends and (B) all were sliced from the wide, flat, non-small end.\n\nSo she removed the tiniest slices but I retrieved the deli package with a \"next time you should slice from the WIDE end.\" Another customer actually rolled his eyes at me!\n\nWhy? Let's see... because the hand guard on the slicer has spikes 1/2 inch deep? So there's always a 1/2 inch heel to throw away, but better trained deli agents make sure that heel happens on the small end? \n\nBecause, perhaps, keeping the small end hermetically sealed (while the middle of any piece is open from the opening of the packaging) helps keep the piece of meat fresh?\n\nThis IS minor and they did give me the meat for free. But seriously, would any trained deli person slice the meat from the short end and expect the customer to pay for it? Or defend themselves from the mistake when the customers complain?\n\nGive me a break. I've worked in restaurants kitchens, grocery stores and I have waited tables. Stanleys, you deserve better - make sure they get trained up.",

Seriously? Organic Mesclun Greens for under $4/lb? SERIOUSLY?!?!?! That shit's like $10 everywhere else! Anyway. There's a good organic section, and some interesting dry goods as well- check out the spices, huge containers for really low prices. As for everyone who complains about fast spoilage, produce is meant to be eaten in a few days. After that it loses all nutritional value and most of it's flavor. So really, you shouldn't let it sit around no matter where you buy it. Not that I can ever manage to eat all the fruits and veggies I buy, but I don't complain about it.",

Have alternatives or a plan to hit the grocery store later just in case Stanley's selection isn't what you are looking for.  Produce can spoil quickly, especially those on special - they need to move them before they rot.  0.99 organic raspberries may seem to be amazing, but keep an eye out for mushy spots and fuzzy mold; some of their produce will need to be  frozen or eaten within a couple days.  You can occasionally find organic for the same or even a little less than conventionally-grown.  Great selection of fresh herbs at unbeatable prices.   Overall, a great alternative if you find yourself cursing out the cantaloupe and steaming at the squash prices at the box grocers.",

I have gone in and wiped out their inventory of Swiss Chard in one fell swoop because my \"vendors\" have sent me unacceptable produce and I send it back, hence my daily runs to Stanley's for something that is peaking versus rotting.  Maybe because the guys see me there all the time, maybe because I always look  crazed and frazzled, but they are like personal shoppers for me and bust out even fresher produce from the back room for me and always help me to my car.  The cashiers are always nice and the guys that work there are really helpful and have special ordered stuff for me when I've hit a wall with vendors.

I love the feeling of filling up my fridge with and walking out of the store with over 4 shopping bags for $20 bucks. I like saving and this place is very reasonable. Parking is available but is limited, I wouldn't recommend going on a weekend.",

The only reason I'm giving it four stars is that the traffic around there is a nightmare and causes me to have tourette-like outbursts.",

            "description": "A nice place to hit it up on produce. I recommend getting the fruit that is absolutely no where near ripe, so you can buy more, save more, and your fruit wont have bruises, and you won't have to worry about a lot other things. Since some of the fruits and veggies are not organic, I recommend spraying it with something by the name of Citrus Cleaner, I believe, and it makes a nice difference. Make sure you seperate your veggies from your fruits because the fruits release gas that can interfere with the flavor of your vegetables. Now, on the other hand speaking of Stanley's, it's an okay place, although it tends to be busier at night and on weekends. The setup is not so great, the people are not so nice, and a lot of the things don't look so good. Must be why it is so cheap because they get the fruits shipped last, and basically that's the scraps. So, make sure you try to get fruits that are not ripe, keep em around your house for a few days, and then eat them. But, before you do, wash it with Citrus Cleaner. I'm sure you can find it at Whole Foods and perhaps other markets such as Trader Joe's, Dominick's, and Jewel. Otherwise, you might as well spray raid on your apple and ask 500 people to touch it. Overall, Stanley's has bad service, bad setup, and is dirty, though the prices are great, and if you get fruits when they aren't ripe, your all set. (I don't recommend the vegetables there).",
