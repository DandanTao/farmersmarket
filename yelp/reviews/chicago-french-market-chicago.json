            "description": "Located in the same building as the Ogilvie Metra Train Station this food vendor & specialty market definitely has a very European feel. Very similar in nature to ones you'd find in train stations in Europe but larger than many of those. Lots of fresh sandwiches, sushi, pierogis, Korean, Belgian Frites, Dim Sum, pizza, vegan, markets with fresh fruits and veggies and many more. Plus you walk in by the French Bakery - who doesn't want a bag of Macarons to take home? \n\nWe came hungry for a late lunch before catching our Metra home and wandered all the aisles before making a decision. I ordered a fresh mozzarella & prosciutto sandwich at Firenze Italian Street Food and my husband got a Tuesday special corned beef sandwich from City Fresh Market. We were both quite happy with our selections. And we did get Macarons on our way out. \n\nThere's a cute area set up with tables that attempts to replicate French Bistro dining. Overall it's definitely an attractive space and you're likely to find something you'll enjoy. Cost for a lunch for 2 is in the $20-25 range. We also noticed there are Happy Hour Specials.",

I take the train every single day into the city for work, and stop in the market at least once a week for goodies.  \n\nThey have some great places in the market, but my favorites are:\n\n1.  Patisserie (when you first walk in, to your right).  The French macarons are AMAZING and the best I've ever had (and expensive!), as well as the filled croissants.  SOOO GOOD.\n\n2.  I can't remember the name, but it's way in the back, and they sell salamis and cured meats.  They have the best pastrami EVER.  You have to order it in advance.  What I do is order a lb of fresh pastrami in the morning when I get off the train around 8:15 a.m.  And I pick it up around 5pm after work before I get on the train.  We fry it in the pan to heat it up, and melt swiss cheese over it and eat it on toasted rye.  Delicious!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n3.  Flip Crepes.  These Gluten-free crepes are delicious!  I usually get the Bam Jam for breakfast, or the Strawberry Dream. That vanilla cream the put inside is decadent.\n\nI haven't been to many of their other vendors, but they really are all good, from what I can tell.\n\nIf you take a train in to the Ogilvie train station, go down the stairs that you see right when you get off the train.  It's downstairs, along with a few other places to eat/shop.",

            "description": "I like this French Market located at the Chicago Ogilvie Transportation Center. If enter the center from the south, you need to go to second floor and follow track 8 and 10 to station then walk down from the station. I like it located at the station give rider to have chance for food before onboard to their trip. \n\nThis market is not too old. Found at 2009. The market become the tourist attraction and so for the local. This market has fresh produce, art, and their original food hall. The art section is small. The market is big enough to get something for your home cooking. However the food hall is big with many vendors for restaurant types of food. \n\nThe food hall line up includes the poke, sushi, dim sum, crepe, Cajun, cheese, Italian pizza and sandwich, raw bar, espresso, Vietnamese, French lunch box, sweet and more. The only thing to prepare is not to go there wear a good clothes. Because the food smells will stick to your clothes. This also come to this area need a good ventilation system for all oil cook smell.",

It was the first Bastille Day Wine and Cheese Event that they have held at the Chicago French Market.  The event was very comprehensive in nature and open to the public. It offered three wine tastings and three cheese tastings which were guided by Pastoral's cheese monger and manager.\n\nI loved every minute of it and hope to attend next year!\n\nFYI-Pastoral Wine and Cheese was one of the first stores that opened in the Chicago French Market and offers specialty cheese, charcuterie and bread, chocolates, crackers, deli sandwiches, cornichons, plus wine & craft beer.",

You can find it here. This place has a large selection of vendors to chose from. Although the vendors rotate every few months, there's always something new and exciting to be found here. I tried the dapper doughnut vendor over the summer, it was delicious but definitely overpriced; 4 tiny doughnut holes came out be around $4 (can't remember the exact price), so keep in mind that the vendors usually charge more than they would at their original locations. With that being said, it's nice to try many different types of food at once at higher prices then visit their restaurant and eat at a more reasonable price if you decide you like the vendor.",

Like any public market, it's a full range of everything you'd ever want for your hectic business lunch schedule and more. Me, I'm from Wisconsin, so if I'm here, it's usually pretty casual, and I'll go with an open mind and empty gut. \nThis last time, I stopped at the deli counter and snagged a prosciutto, Brie and blueberry sandwich. Yup. It was as amazing in my mouth as it was odd on paper.\nI also made a stop at the poke stand, and grabbed me a bowl of fish and avo and veg that I scooped up with the homemade tortilla chips. Delish!\nAnd that's just the two items I chose THAT day.",

In reality it felt more like a waste of time (especially considering how far we walked to get here, that was on me, should have ubered). \n\nWhen I think of a market I assume there will be a variety of vendors.  Not here, it's just prepared food... aside from one florist.  And had I not just ate the largest breakfast of my life before getting here, I would have like to have grabbed a coffee and a macaron or even a crape! Sadly that was not what how my time played out. We walked in a circle looked at all the food we didn't want, then left.\n\nIf you stop in for a meal, I'd say you would have an enjoyable time.

            "description": "Not to be confused with the Chicago French Kiss, which happened to me several times last time I was here.\n\nThe French Market in Chicago is an expensive little indoor market that is along similar lines to the West Side Market in Cleveland and the North Market in Columbus. It's a little bit larger than the latter and perhaps is more evoking the Philadelphia Reading Terminal Market - but nowhere near as busy or as popular. Nor as good.\n\nYet parking around here is just as difficult! I would have thought that it would have been a little easier considering this isn't in the most fashionable neighbourhood of Chicago unlike the Reading Terminal Market of Philly, but they're definitely milking it for all it's worth.\n\nNevertheless it deserves four stars because it's the kind of place that tourists can come and feel warm and safe and have a lot of different options. Overpriced and sometimes hipster options but nevertheless, options.",

I had never heard of a French Market in Chicago, and I'm sad that I've never been here before! The atmosphere and setup reminded me a bit of North Market in Columbus, Ohio if you've ever been. There were a bunch of different food places like a macaron spot, an organic vegetable and fruit shop, a donut place, a polish stop, and so much more . I stopped at the macaron spot and got a 6 pack (coconut, rose, hazelnut, lavender, raspberry, and mango), and they all were very good.

            "description": "WOW! I love the Chicago French Market. I commuted from the suburbs to the city for school and the French Market was a safe haven for me while waiting for my trains.\n\nThe Chicago French Market is made up of lots of booths offering an array of services from food to small gifts. It does get really busy but its also downtown Chicago (so not really surprising). It is a great place to go if you are looking for lunch, flowers for your girlfriend, or just a fun afternoon of roaming around!\n\nI personally think the location is perfect especially for commuters. It is directly connected to Ogilvie Transportation Center (train station). You don't even need to leave the building to get here or to your train! \n\nPerfect. The market itself has a romantic, cozy, yet bustling vibe to it. It is very inviting and I could easily spend a few hours roaming the booths and the stations.\n\nThey have options went from around the world. They also have tons of vegetarian and vegan options. The BEST thing that I got here was macarons. Oh wow, they were some of the best macarons I have ever had. I would highly suggest!! I also found it a really useful stop to get a quick lunch or dinner or even a box of wine for my train ride home. \n\nIf you are ever at OTC or just in the area, definitely stop through here. I doubt you will be disappointed as there seems to be a little something for everyone.",

            "description": "I was a little hesitant about this place, but it did not disappoint!  With all the food halls these days, there are many that aren't up to par, but the French Market offered lots of great eateries and seating.  I was shocked at the size of this place, there were so many vendors here.  Some vacancies which were a little concerning, but there seemed to be a decent number of people around.  \n\nAnother surprise to me was that the hours here are much more day oriented with not much of a night scene, this includes a lack of alcohol which most food halls typically have.  I came during the day so I wasn't looking out to drink, but just a warning if that's what you're after.\n\nAs for what I had, I'm not sure if I want to go into too much detail, but the Vietnamese place was great.  So was the crepe place.  Some of the restaurants here offer smaller portioned tapas which I thought was great, especially for those looking to try rather than just have one entree.  \n\nOverall, I'd say this is a great food hall with pretty decent theming.  It's fairly accessible if you're in the area.  The food offerings here are fantastic with a lot of variety.  And there's plenty of seating so you don't have to concern yourself with that either.",

The beef was so flavorful and tender. We also tried the classic bahn mi but I definitely like the pho one better! \n\nAs for the crepe place, we got two crepes- one with just butter and sugar and the other with butter, sugar and lemon. Between those two, we definitely liked the plain butter and sugar one more. The lemon juice was a little too overpowering. The crepes were fluffy, which is different from an authentic French crepe but still yummy nonetheless. They sell packets of the crepe flour for you to make at home. \n\nThe seating was plentiful and they even have free WiFi. There was also a musician there singing and playing guitar.

Despite it nearly constant state of bustling crowds I have never felt inconvenienced, packed in, uncomfortable. Quite the opposite. I've never had to really wait in line for any of the wonderful vendors, or left wanting because I gave up waiting on my donuts, pizza, sushi, or beer. Yes, that is the plethora of edibles with many, many more I haven't tried yet. Bubble tea, french pastries and crepes, exotic chocolate truffles, even a fruit stand and a tiny deli with salted meats; everything you could want within a short distance to the Metra.\n\nOne note, is despite all my praise this market still has big-city price tags. If you are look for dollar energy drinks, or cheap pre-processed snacks, this is not your place. However, if you want a better experience in general, want a place to soak in the energy while you eat, relax, and refresh the extra price might very well be worth it.\n\nI have talked about one particular vendor here before, but the whole market deserves its shout-out because it really lives up to its name. Much like the European markets I've envisioned in my mind the French Market embodies all the comfort of a warm crowd with the added benefits of being downtown Chicago, an oasis from a hectic city, especially in winter. I have had wonderful, and brief conversations with complete strangers, passing through on their way to the train, but stopping for a quick drink, or bite to eat. I thoroughly believe it is the layout and orientation of this venue that feels welcoming if albeit a bit touristy.",

And so many options you could come back everyday for a month and get something different. \n\nConglomerate of a variety of food vendors and cuisines to select from (more than just French food). There are about 3-4 'lanes' of food stalls. \n\nThere is an entrance at Clinton and also two entrances near the metra station. Also in the station is a CVS if you want to grab a cheap drink instead.",

If I can eat pierogies, Italian sandwiches, and French macarons all in the same place, I'm a happy gal. \n\nMost of the vendors inside are a little pricey and there's definitely some room for improvement, but I think it's worth a stop if just for the novelty.",

Saigon Sisters has delicious Vietnamese sandwiches and pho, and you cannot go wrong with anything from Black Dog for dessert (my favorite ice cream/gelato in all of Chicagoland). This is a great place to take out of towners to show off some of the fresh, high quality food our city has to offer. The atmosphere will transport you, and you can even grab snacks from the grocery section to fuel your downtown adventures (they have a wide variety of candies and yogurts).",

This is a great place to enjoy a great mix of premium foods without ever wandering into the sometimes cold and wet streets of downtown. Depending on the time, you may be able to also enjoy some free entertainment in a cozy setting.\n\nThe stores here change from time to time, although a few have remained in business for quite a while. It's competitive to own a restaurant in the loop and the French Market is not immune to this, despite naturally being located in a busy area. In particular, 2 staple restaurants I like are:\n\nVanille Patisserie: Despite lots of great places to get sweets in the loop, the elegance, clean flavors, premium ingredients, delicate designs, and clear themes in the food here make it worth the premium price for a treat.\n\nFrietkoten: The heartiness and crispiness of these fries matched with the well-tuned sauces, all at reasonable prices makes this the standard by which I judge all other fries in Chicago.\n\nEven if you are not dining here, there's several shops such as city fresh market, pastoral, fumare, and city fresh produce offering meats, cheeses, and fruits for reasonable prices. \n\nOther options range from Vietnamese to donuts to gourmet pastries to seafood to BBQ and others. Not all options here are the best, but overall they are above average and enjoyable (or else they go out of business within a year).\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you take the train into the city or are a tourist to Chicago. You'll get exposed to lots of great food in a convenient spot. Also, check out revival food hall nearby for some other premium options.",

The French market offers produce, groceries, kombucha, Health drinks, and snacks in the front of the market. To the right of the grocery section as I call it, they have the cutest cupcake stand. This is called vanille. The cupcakes are rather dear, but they are very beautiful. I like to go here to pick up special birthday treats for my friends and coworkers. A typical treat could be $3.25 to $10. The staff here is very sweet they're usually young girls who do an excellent job wrapping your cupcakes and sending you on your way. The French market has Asian cuisine, French cuisine, crepes, vegan, sandwiches, and chocolates. No matter what you are in the mood for, you can find it at the French market.",

The stalls come in all sizes and the smells are tantalizing. \n\nI decided to visit some vendors instead of others due to the warmth and reception of the counter workers--as in real street markets, I'm willing to spend my money on whoever draws me in-- \n\nThe place was jam packed at 5:00pm but each booth had their lines figured out so there was never any cutting or running into each other; I was able to peruse and leave or peruse and stay.\n\nWhat I enjoyed most about this place was the fact that there were So Many Options- BBQ / Sushi /  Pastries / Crepes / French Fries / Beer & Wine / Donuts / Juices / Tacos /  Flowers / Cheese / Thai / Korean / Fruit & Veggie Market and even a GRILLED.

It may have been in the past, but it seems like the French has migrated back or away from this venue. \n\nThere is a crepe vendor in here which has a variety of crepe selections, but it is more of a US fusion of crepe than French. The taste and price is decent however. We had a Smokehouse Crepe for $8.35 (as in the name, I don't think Smokehouse is French!). Moreover, I bought a cup of coffee here and I think the French won't be happy.... \n\nI give it a 3 stars because of the decor, otherwise a 2 star. \n\nLow down: worth a visit once but don't come hungry.",

Or people who eat there did not have been to France or they eat whatever and give it five stars.. \nI have bookmarked this place and couldn't wait to go there. I am very disappointed with overall experience. \nFirst of all, we couldn't find parking. Which was let's say ok, it is place for people around area to grab and go lunches or quick eat inside. \nThere are plenty of different shops inside but we decided to grab a lobster roll. I am kind of person who will give last penny for my hedonistic spirit. But 16$ lobster roll sandwich?! The problem is not about the money it is about the roll. It is not even a tasteless,it is like a snack. It is not worth it for a lunch. The roll is two slices of bread filled with mixed green salad, topped with lobster tail meat, and sprinkled with garlic butter. Like side you get pickles. Does it worth 16$? No. It was good?! It was not soo bad. \nAcross the Lobster stand there was sort of praline chocolaterie. And I didn't trust them to pay 14$ for 4 (the smallest size box) praline. \nWhen we were walking trough the marketplace to the setting point we run into the some sort of bakery Vanilla bakery and it seemed that they have nice cakes. Outside was very hot so we decided to skip. Otherwise they will be ruined. \nI wanted fries so we grabbed reccomended one next to the sitting court and it was decent. Hand peeled and freshly fried. Just ok. \nI just didn't liked that place. We had two rolls, two Sodas, large fries and with parking we paid more than 50$. Was it worth it? No. \nWould I recommend it? No. Chicago offers a huge palette of food points you can try that you should not spend anytime here.",

I like that there are many different options for food, from poke bowls to sushi to Italian street food to desserts to crepes to French to vegan to empanadas, and even raw food! But the two things that are lacking are (1) more options for wine and (2) better seating. Regarding #1, there is literally one bar that serves any alcohol, and the wine selection is just plain sad. And they will serve you your wine in a plastic cup if you don't drink it at their counter. How classy is that? And, by the way, how can you call yourself a \"French\" market and have barely any wine options? Regarding #2, there are a handful of tables on the east side of the building, but it reminds me of a cafeteria. The ambience could certainly be better. \n\nIf I had to add another issue, It would also be great to have more options for ice cream or gelato. If you visit their website, they claim to have one vendor that serves gelato, but when I visited last time, they were not offering it.\n\nAnyway, the food is certainly good, and there is so much variety in the different cuisine that is offered. But I'm so thirsty for a good glass of wine. Please quench my thirst.",

There were definitely some other spots that caught my eye, and one of these times we'll have to make a proper go of eating our way through or grabbing some goodies for our trip home. \n\nThe setting itself is pretty drab and calling the entrance understated is an understatement, so I don't know if I'd go out of my way to visit, but since we usually get to town via the OTC it's become part of our routine.",

I had the Chicago Style Roll which was with Sriracha Mayo & Topped with spicy giardiniera and warm garlic butter! My friend got the Traditional Style which was with tarragon mayo & topped with warm garlic buttery and celery salt. Both were delish! Both were paired with a light coleslaw. Apparently it was National Lobster Day..so I deff took advantage of that! If you like seafood..please check out this vendor!\n\nI also had coffee from Polpetti! It had a Cubano twist..dark roast..just sweet enough!

            "description": "An undiscovered gem in the heart of downtown Chicago. Dozens of unique food vendors packed into a bustling market setting under the train tracks. Vendors run the gamut from raw food/vegan to tiny dessert doughnuts to banh mi to lobster rolls. It's all anchored by the terrific City Fresh Market which serves up great deli fare and a great little market with packaged and fresh grocery items.\n\nThere is plenty of seating but it's tough to find a spot at peak lunch hours and there is frequent live music as well. Overall it's a great place to visit and if you work downtown it gives tons of daily lunch options.",

            "description": "This is a delightful marketplace chock full of goodness located in the Ogilvie Transportation Center-the other train station downtown.\n\nAssuming you try to drive here there is convenient (sort of) covered, ground-level parking available in the metra market parking lot located just north of Randolph, along with street parking but look-this is a train station -so there will be dozens of buses and trains coming here everyday, and Chicago traffic is beyond fierce. You are best served by getting here any other way that does not involve driving a car. The El and the other train depot-union station-are both within easy walking distance. If you for some bizarre reason (such as being a masochist) do end up in that parking garage and wind up spending more then 20 bucks (easy to do) at the market, the first hour is free. Otherwise the parking is a Chicago bargain at a mere six dollars every 30 minutes. Rounded up. thus 31 minutes will be twelve dollars.\n\nBoth the street facing entrance or the totally innocuous train platform entrances give no indication of the wonders contained within. Inside there is a dining area with some more or less comfortable chairs next to a decent full size mural designed to make you think you are not underneath one of the largest train stations in america, an effect somewhat ruined by the the wall shaking effect every 45 minutes when a train arrives and/or departs. There is also a limited amount of outside seating in the summer, and some cozy little two spots scattered around here and there. \n\nOther then the seating the real gem here is the thirty to forty shops selling various foods from around the world. There is a butcher, a seafood shop that will steam anything, mexican street food, polish kielbasa, belgian frites, burgers, raw foods, several sweet shops, b\u00e1nh m\u00ec, sushi, wraps, tri tip, green grocers, kosher, bakeries, pickles (both american and Indian), halal, pastrami,gnocchi, gelato, poke,beef bourguignon,artisan cheeses, coffee,  burgers and well a true american smorgasbord in all it's diverse grandeur. In other words a pocket food paradise cleverly hidden in a train depot. From time to time there will be live music. Pricing ranges from four bucks for soup or some other small item to several hundred dollars for a magnum of champagne and some caviar. Generally speaking lunch will be in the 15 dollar ish range. Bring some extra in order to take some stuff home for later though. \n\nOverall it's an absolutely amazing place for anyone that likes food.",

If you're in mood for Japanese food there is vendor for you. We decided check out seafood. I ordered lobster roll which came steamed or chilled and topped with an amazing sauce and bacon. It was crispy soft and full of amazing aromas. There is also a little bar where we actually ate our food. It has wine and beer which went well with the food. There are also multiple chocolate, dessert and fruit vendors you can choose from. I would definitely come back here in future when I return to Chicago.",

            "description": "Imagine a grocery store except the aisles are lined with little restaurant booths rather than shelves. Super cool place, you can kill a solid hour just looking at all the food. There's poke, lobster, baked potatoes, wine/cheese, sandwiches, boba, cupcakes, it's all here. Also the place is air conditioned, a key step in heatstroke prevention. It did not go unnoticed!\n\nAs far as the food goes I have only had the pleasure of trying the wine and cheese place, it's called Pastoral and there's another location on Lake street, too. I don't know jack shit about cheese so I relied heavily on the staff there to help me choose the chief cheese for the occasion (a concert in Millenium park). They let you try a lot of cheeses and they actually know and care a ton about the cheese. I discovered that I am a fan of nutty Spanish cheeses that have medium-hard consistency and are made from sheep, goat, and cows milk. What will I do with this information? The possibilities are simply endless. I forgot what the cheese was called also, but that's on me. But it was a fabulous cheese indeed.\n\nWow this turned into more of a review for pastoral than for French market. Anyway, French market is dope, and under the assumption that the booths are similar in quality, you're going to have an informative and scrum-diddly-umptious time there.",

Thankfully a co-worker of mine suggested a group of us meet there for lunch...I am so glad he did. \n\nSure, it was busy at lunchtime, but that was to be expected. In my opinion, the wait made it possible for me to scout out many of the other businesses (from the waiting line), that occupy the market. My colleagues went for the Aloha Poke, but Lillie's BBQ smelled too good for me to pass up. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich with coleslaw in the bun, and what I love about Lillie's is the fact you can choose your type of BBQ sauce on the side. I ordered up sweet & mild sauce. It was so good I wanted to drink it straight out of the container. Let's just say in the end, I used up every last drop. \n\nOther vendors I noticed...Beaver Donuts & Coffee, grilled cheese sandwiches, a deli stop for bulk salads and homemade turkey sammies, a crepe station, and killer good looking cupcakes. But, the one place I couldn't keep my eyes off of is the Kosher deli. I'm super curious to find out how authentic it is. Hmmm...seems like another review to come?\n\nThere is indoor seating, and some tables come with umbrellas...super cute. We were able to snag a small stand up table for the four of us. \n\nMy first French Market experience was simply perfect all the way around. Cheers!",

If you can't decide what type of food you're in the mood for, this is the place to go. It's a little off the beaten path for a tourist but seems to be a hot spot for commuters, which (in my opinion) makes it even better. You want to go where the locals go. \n\nThere were a few empty spots but otherwise was bustling and the smells caused my stomach to grumble in response.

            "description": "I don't live in Chicago, so I assume it's over my head why this is called the \"French\" Market. Considering it isn't all French. Can anybody help me out here? I mean, Eataly, for example, is at least mostly Italian. It's not even like the French Market is all European because there's a Mexican restaurant and a Vietnamese restaurant and Da Lobsta. Maybe I'm not culturally savvy enough to get it. I'll keep trying.\n\nIn the meantime, I'll continue with my unenlightened review. I swung in for lunch midweek, and ho boy, that was a mistake. To say it was bustling and cramped was an understatement. Between that and the market-style atmosphere, I felt like I was in France. Maybe I just solved my query. Except I've never been to France so I don't actually know if it's like France. Plus, America is also bustling and cramped. I've just decided it should be called the \"Chicago Market\", regardless of why it has \"French\" in the name.\n\nThe only thing found in abundance here are food options. Everything else--including available seating, personal space, and clearly marked exits--are absent. Of course, my stupid self went with choices that weren't French. I tried Da Lobsta, which consisted of weak lobster and puny pasta noodles. Sad! Then I grabbed an horchata from the Mexican restaurant because this drink is like, impossible to find anywhere for some reason.\n\nUnless I literally worked next to this place, I don't think I'd ever come here. I like Chicago and the French and markets, but apparently the three combined don't work well.",

I live about four blocks north of here, and it's my one-stop destination for a great take-out meal, and especially for putting together a spread to entertain friends.  \n\nI've purchased things from about half of the 30 or so vendors and have my favorites. Pastoral Artisan Cheese has an outstanding selection, and the counter people are helpful at selecting complementary cheeses for a tray. It's also a good place to pick up a loaf of fresh bread and bottle of wine, too. Furmare meats is nearby, and they deserve their reputation as The Sandwich King. Can't beat their locally cured pastrami on rye with hot mustard... several hearty soups, too.  \n\nThere are many choices for sweets, but Delightful Pasteries is above the rest. Nothing compares to their specialty cakes for parties, and the absolute best are Death by Chocolate and Tira Mi Su. (I say, why waste your calories an anything less than pure butter and chocolate!)  \n\nIf you crave macaroons, you'll find them at several of the stalls. There's a stall just for lobster, and their rolls are pretty good (not great)  Saigon Sisters Vietnamese food is available for take-out. If you want to sit down and enjoy your meal, there are several options for that, too.\n\nMy only suggestion is to be prepared to wait in line during lunch. They don't have enough people behind the counters to serve the crowds. Note that French Market is closed on Sundays.  \n\nSeveral Yelpers have complained about high prices, but I don't agree. The prices for fresh produce, meat, fish and cheese are comparable to Mariano's and Whole Foods. Bakery goods are conpetitive, too.",

Tight quarters, lots of food stalls and potential customers getting in your way constantly and a few merchants selling random things like scarves and knick knacks.  Several of the food stalls are bit expensive for a quick lunch but they all sound great when you're hungry.  Lobster rolls, hot dogs, chicken tikka masala, crepes, pho, fresh donuts and a few different bakeries and chocolate shops.  There's even a little mini grocery store for fresh fruit and a meat market if you want to gnaw on a raw t-bone steak on the train ride back. I should have been down here sooner.",

Ummm, no thanks -- for something that costs \u20ac2 (or less) in France. What a disappointment.

There's seriously something here for everyone. There's a few delis, a crepe place and macarons for those who want to keep it French, a place for beer and fries, vegan places, donuts, bubble tea.

And  hardly any of the vendors were, French as I was expecting. \n\nFlip Crepe was a good value for such a large size crepe; Mexican restaurant huevos ranchos came with rice and beans for only $7, and mini donuts for $2! \n\nWasn't quite what I expected but would go here again to try out other shops.",

It can handle any palette and even has a mini grocery store! I go here for lunch from time to time.

It seemed more like a place to buy candy and popcorn more than anything, especially a french market.\n\nI gave it a second chance out of necessity. I was commuting to my parent's house frequently, many times unexpectedly, and this was my chance to grab food before boarding a train. I noticed that the caliber of vendors had improved and I could not only get some healthy options, like fresh fruit, but some damn good food too. Pastoral is my go to vendor there, but there are some other great choices as well like Aloha Poke, Saigon Sisters and Black Dog Gelato.\n\nIt still doesn't transport me to the bank of the Seine or France at all, but a trip to Ogilve means I'll be going out of my way to stop into the market for something tasty. Color me impressed at the turnaround from its early days.",

There were, however, plenty of stands with desserts and baked goods, a stand which sold meatloaf cupcakes, Saigon Sisters with Vietnamese food, a stand that specialized in meatball subs, a donut stand, a lobster stand, a bubble tea stand, and more. So, you will definitely find something you like here! I went around lunchtime on a Friday and it certainly was busy, but not packed. There were lots of vendors handing out samples around that time, and you could probably get reasonably full just eating those. \n\nMy boyfriend got some bubble tea from Bello Tea, which we were disappointed in. We ordered coconut taro, and it was made with a powder mix that wasn't mixed very well (we saw them shake the drink in a water bottle a few times and that was it), so it was gritty and also way too sweet. Our cup was also filled 80% ice so I feel like we got a really bad deal given the priciness of the drink. \n\nWe also had some fries from Frietkoten, which were awesome. Super crispy, not greasy (even though they were double-fried) with lots of sauce options to choose from.",

It was 10:30AM on a Thursday and Aloha already had a long line, whereas all the other vendors were empty.\n\nThere are cute donut shops, bakeries, bbq, asian, and seafood options too.\n\nThere's a transportation center right there so people getting on the commuter rail have plenty of options to choose from and clean bathrooms too.\n\nAs a tourist pit stop, I'd take a pass, but it was in between visiting the Big Monster Door and the conservatory.",

My daughter has been trying to get me here but lost me when she called it \"deconstructed sushi\". I prefer my food \"constructed\" in its usual artificial way. Anyway, it was delicious. I got the Alpha with Salmon and she had the crunchy with Salmon. The flavor and sauce works together wonderfully. The best part is that you can do add on's for no extra cost. \n\nWe went after lunch hour but apparently the line can be incredibly long for this particular restaurant. \n\nThere are several other places to eat. Next to Aloha was Lillies Que which we frequent over on North avenue quite often.\n\nThey have a fresh market as well as places that serve beer. Can't wait to try them all.",

If you go during happy hour (4-6pm), many places have discounts like 4 for $40 lobster rolls at Da Lobsta which is a steal! They also have places where you can buy groceries and fresh fish although the prices are steep (maybe you should just go to Mariano's for groceries?)\n\nCareful though, this place can get crowded since there are a lot of office buildings around. I recommend going during dinner if you have time. Unfortunately it closes at 7:30pm most days, most vendors close up shop before then so if you wanna grab dinner come right after work and take something to go.\n\nI've tried most of the places here, and they're all pretty solid. Not gonna lie I think the best part are the dessert places (eg Black dog gelato, Beavers donuts, Vanille Patisserie).",

The quality of the food stands is definitely variable. Some are much . When I was visiting there were quite a bit of empty stalls. Not super consistent on cleanliness. I get that each of the stands is independently run, but having some standards around look and feel could benefit everyone in there.\n\nThere's a nice common seating area, which mimics the outdoor patio of a low end restaurant. There is certainly opportunity here to make it a bit more upscale without losing the casual feel of the market.\n\nI liked the Poke stop!

There were a surprising amount of plant-based and healthy options too!",

            "description": "I went there when it first opened and it was still spotty and hadn't found its groove yet, but this time was different.  Went for lunch on a Saturday and it was wonderful.  The vendors have filled out nicely, offering a wide range of delicious choices.  From artisan cheese shops to crepes, Vietnamese, Indian, lobster, French, Ribs, Italian coffee stands, artisan cakes & cookies, raw and even a Girl and the Goat station.\n\nI had the chili from The Girl and the Goat station which was hot and very tasty.  I also had a fabulous freshly prepared lentil soup from the Le Cafe du Marche. \n\nThe back seating area is designed to feel like you are sitting under the Eiffel Tower and a terrific jazz guitarist complimented the scene nicely. \n\nFood is quick and prices are reasonable considering the ambiance. Free parking if you spend $20 and relatively easy street parking make it a nice alternative for a weekend brunch joint.",

I requested my bubble tea be made less sweet than normal, and they did a great job with it! My friend's lavender tea was AMAZING -- might have to give it a try next time I'm here. \n\nThis would be a really great spot to stop by for lunch or just for random munchies during the day.

It also reminded me of the Mercado San Miguel, an indoor market in Madrid... this is place is so refreshing and outshines the countless food chains around the Loop. \n\nWhat a wonderful establishment filled with cheeses, olives, fresh produce, delectable sandwiches!  I loved the bustle of people who will take time out of their day to grab some quality food.\n\nThere were so many options, Indian, French, Thai, and also a branch of the Girl & the Goat.  While I've only tried two sandwiches from Pastoral so far- both priced at $7.52 (\"Cali Chevre\" and \"Sinfully Healthy\" which includes a great mango chutney)- I would come here again to try other sandwiches, like the \"Blue Pig N' Fig.\"  Pastoral also has an olive bar with free sampling of their cornichons and at least six kinds of olives...\n\nI just did a quick walk-around the French Market.  Well lit, wide aisles to mosey down and people-watch and dream about what to eat next.  There is a warmth that draws you inside, plus ample seating just outside the market area. There are so many places to try and it's a happy, food-made-with-love kind of place.  I will no doubt be coming back bientot!",

People are pretty organized and step out of the way when they're waiting for food, but I will say that some of the kiosks are set up better than others and much more conveniently.  You can easily tell which restaurants/shops are the most popular during lunch time as you'll wait 20 min for one spot or 2 min for another, but I personally think all of the spots are good and use fresh ingredients.  You can even shop for food to prepare for dinner or wine to bring to a party - quite convenient.\n\nI will say that I think their seating area can be a bit more organized.  People are fighting for spots and there's not a ton of room.  I realize they can't exactly add more space, but it's tough to sit there and eat - much easier to pick things up to go.\n\nWorth a visit for lunch/ice cream/shopping/wine pickups/etc.  Good addition to the train station.",

It's like flowers and caramelized garlic. Maybe that description doesn't appeal to you but just imagine the most delicious smell you can and that's it!\n\nThe market is always orderly even when it's very crowded. I think this is because of the layout. There's plenty of room for people to wait in line at one booth without blocking another. Also, the dining area is always orderly and it's big enough to accommodate large crowds of people without feeling overrun.

Of course, you can find vegetables and fruits but mostly little spots to eat and you have plenty of choices. I stopped at Aloha Poke for lunch (decision was made when I saw the word Poke which is kinda my new thing now). There weren't much people, the service was great and I was greeted with smiles. I ordered a marinated Tuna Volcano Poke over White Rice and honestly it was one of the best I've tasted so far! All the ingredients were fresh and well seasoned. After I went to an Ice Cream spot (which unfortunately I do not remember the name), and I had goat cheese and caramelized peanut Ice cream and it tasted very good!

Tucked away with the trains is a lively and festive food court market with a really eclectic mix of vendors offering just about everything you can think of. My daughter is a huge fan of the crepes and macaroons. My wife and I were in the mood for a burger so we hit the Belgian burger bar and ordered two number ones with fries. I noticed the fries were a big hit with lots of other folks just ordering fries. The fries were nice and crispy just like I like them. True to Dutch form they offer mayonnaise along with the fries for free, along with ketchup as well. If you want to get fancy they also have flavored sauces for 75 cents per or 3 for $2. I was also glad to see they had malted vinegar as well. If you have not had fries with malted vinegar yet, you are missing out. What was also surprising were the prices during happy hour - $2 PBR tallboy, multiple bottled belgians for $3?! Really good homemade mushroom soup for $3.50. Also nice to have was the complimentary live music during happy hour and the sitting area where you could nosh on your selections. I would totally come here again and this marks the second food court/market type place that I have been to downtown that is a bookmark go to. Next on our hit list is the Italian market.",

Seated and standing tables are located in one dedicated area.\n\nThe French Market itself sells produce and packaged goods at prices comparable to Whole Foods, and it's a convenient place to pick up some things before catching your train.\n\nOn weekdays, this place is packed during lunch and less crowded during dinner.",

Whether you're dropping in quickly to pick up lunch to go or if you're wanting to try something new-- The Chicago French Market is the place. \n\nI took a colleague from Texas here the other day and we had a blast. First time for both of us. We had quite a few meetings in the loop and decided to have lunch here. \n\nThere is a parking garage but there was no attendant. It took us a good 5 minutes to see the tiny sign on the hut that said \"parking full--monthly only\" but there is street parking surrounding the building, it's usually all taken though. Drive north a bit and there's a small side street with a lot of metered parking. \n\nWe ordered from Da Lobsta, original lobster sandwich. SO DELICIOUS!! The workers there were very nice and helpful. \n\nWe also got desserts from Lolli and Pop. I got a couple truffles and 2 Petit Fours for my husband and I to share. They have so many flavors and designs. It was difficult to choose only four. But the selections I made were to die for.. Can't wait to go back and try something else. It seems like anything you get from them is delish. \n\nWe walked around quite a bit and got to see all the vendors. They market had a wide array of food selections, if you are here with a big group there is something for everyone. \n\nThere isn't a lot of space for tables. Just a corner of the market. I would suggest staking a table out and having someone save it for you and you can order food in shifts.",

There are a lot of reviews here saying \"well, it's not EXACTLY like the markets in France and I don't really feel like I'm in Paris\". Ummm...it's in the basement of the Metra station in downtown Chicago so what do you expect?\n\nI actually find it authentic in the sense that the FM reminds me of the small markets attached to train stations in France & Germany. There are multiple places to grab a quick bite, pick up something to heat up at home or score some treats. I especially like the inclusion of cuisines that are historically French influenced like Vietnamese, Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois & Belgian. Sure, there are some outliers - sushi, Indian, a raw food place, but you certainly won't lack for choice. \n\nI had a delightful pate sandwich and Pastoral, some yummy tea from Bello and I grabbed some treats from Vanille on the way out. (Couldn't resist the macaron case)\n\nWould I make a special trip? Questionable - unless I was dying for some macarons and couldn't get to Lincoln Park. But you can bet I'll stop if I'm nearby.",

I'm so happy it's here. Ceci n'est pas Paris, afterall.\n\nFlowers, fresh herbs and vegetables, meats, cheeses and wine- stop here on your way home for that one thing you need to make dinner at home! Market success.\n\nLunch- Da Lobsta, Lillie's Q, Saigon Sisters, a good selection, albeit a small selection of eateries.\n\nI enjoyed my Banh Mi from Saigon Sisters, washed down with a Beetacular juice from Loop Juice.\n\nFor your commute home, for lunch, the Chicago French Market is easy \"brie-z\"!",

A burger topped with smoked Gouda cheese and an egg, how could you go wrong? We tried several dipping sauces for the frites but settled on the truffle mayo a our favorite.

For example, it is very similar to the maket in Philly. \n\nThere are many unique businesses here. (I am not sure of the names of them...sorry!!!). \n\nOne place had cheese...in fact it was the only place that had cheese. We were able to sample them before buying them. Yummy!   They also sold a spicy concentrate for  bloody Mary's.  It was really good and it is the only place in Chicago that carries it. \n\nThere is a nice florist and a place to buy homemade soap products too. Definitely unique gifts for a special someone. \n\nAnd if you are hungry there is plenty to choose from: Sandwiches, Asian, pasta, etc...  One place that I am going to go back and try is the Belgium Fry place.  They severe them just like in Europe in a cone except this cone has been supersized American style!!!\n\nThis is a great us of space. I can hardly wait to come back.  I keep dreaming of the fries!!!\n\nI also noticed stairs up to the different Metra Tracks but is another adventure for another day!!!",

I promise it's just like Paris except everyone speaks English - no translator needed! Within the French Market, you can find a large variety of vendors selling almost anything! Some of my favorite places to frequent are:\n\n1) LaVazza Coffee: they have some of the best lattes and cappuccinos in the city IMHO - definitely worth getting on one of these frigid Chicago winter days. \n\n2) Vanille Patisserie: macarons - nuff said. The price can be pricey, but their flavors are very unique, which change daily, but beware, they sell out in a jiffy so you gotta get here early!\n\n3) Frietkoten Belgian Fries: Belgium isn't exactly in France, but it's in Europe right? So, you get to hit up two countries at the same time - perfect! Their thick cut Belgian fries are amazingly crisp and come in a huge cone. I would go with the small size - I came with three people and we struggled to finish it. Additionally, the fries come with the standard mayo for dipping, but they offer other dipping sauces as well for additional charge, such as truffle mayo, fire roasted pepper, garlic mayo and more. \n\n4) Beavers Coffee and Donuts: Their donuts are the reason I keep coming back. Wide selection of mini and regular size donuts that run the gamut of being filled, cake donuts, glazed - you name it, they got it. Coffees aren't half bad either. \n\n5) Saigon Sisters: great bahn mis, which are Vietnamese stuffed with just about everything and piled up with pickled veggies and fresh herbs - Oh, did I mention we're making a pit stop in Vietnam too? \n\nThese five vendors don't do this place justice. There are other bakeries, grocers, seafood mongers, deli and more! You just have to check it out for yourself. Believe you will thank me when you do. If you want to drive, there is a parking garage located in the middle of the building which can be confusing to find. However, you can only park for 1 hour for free, that's the catch so I'd recommend taking public transportation because you can't explore the entire market in an hour!",

It was clean and nice, well organized with clean restrooms.  The sun was shining on the tables and chairs outside - I even got a little sunburnt.\n\nBut we tried gelato and molasses ginger cookies and did not finish either one.  Yes, you read that right, I left a sweet unconsumed.  I am a Molasses ginger cookie freak and only ate one stale bite.  I had better ones from Costco.\n\nOh French Market, I wanted you and I to be lovers.  I will try again to see if I can raise your rating.  Je regrette....",

            "description": "Been here more than 20 times, it's one of my happy places.  I've eaten at nearly every vendor, there's really no bad place to eat here!  On Saturdays, sometimes I just go grab a whole bunch of different things and share with a group of friends.  \n\nSaigon Sisters and Pastoral get lots of shout outs, so I will name some other tasty treats!\n\nDelightful Pastries has amazing 'Rainbow Cookies', which are actually little slices of fluffy layered cake with chocolate and jams inspired by the Italian flag.  Like a million flavors, all heavenly!\n\nLoop Soup has an apple pie grilled cheese!  Some people are scared, staring at the menu board in disbelief.....don't listen to them....get it!\n\nDa Lobsta has the buttery-est toasty Texas toast buns with giant piles of lobster!  They come across pricey, but I swear theres like a whole lobster on one roll.  And no imitation filler either, you will see all lobster!\n\nFlip Crepes has a Croq' Madame Sandwich with savory bechamel sauce (reminds me a bit of white country gravy) and a fried egg.  They were happy to offer me the option to do cheddar and turkey rather than ham and swiss.  So amazing!\n\nFrietkoten Belgian Fries & Beer didn't really jump out at me until I saw they had curry mayo and curry ketchup for their fries!  Also wasabi sauce and peanut sauce!  I'm not the biggest fry fan, but the sauces totally make them! p:\n\nBello Tea has so many great flavors of bubble tea.....how do you choose?  I highly recommend coconut taro also passion fruit.  I know everyone gets tapioca pearls, but try the coconut jelly!  It's not as filling and still fun and chewy!\n\nLolli and Pops is new, you won't miss the giant gorgeous display case with rows of luscious truffles!  Yes, they are pricey, but so worth it!  If you just want to treat yourself to one or two, don't be afraid, they won't pressure you to buy more!  So many neat flavors like strawberry balsamic and marion berry vodka!\n\nLoop Juice has some amazing fresh squeezed juices!  I especially love the Detox with carrot, apple and ginger, so refreshing!  If you are in a hurry, I would suggest having a juice as a great meal on the go.  Super healthy and filling!  \n\nBeavers Coffee and Donuts, I have yet to have your coffee, but you have marshmallow crispy treat mini donuts!!!!  It's hard to resist watching the magic deep fryer pop out the little donuts and watch them swim around until they are toasty brown......but then you added marshmallow cream drizzle and rice crispies????  Sold!\n\nLILLIE'S Q always seems to close a little early, so try to snag some before they close!  Super tender BBQ and lots of great sauces to choose from!  The Carolina Gold is a nice change from your usual sauces, it's more a mustard base, and Ivory is a mayo base. \n\nI was sad to see Lavazza and Little Goat Bread go.  But they have other locations, highly recommend both!  Also I'm not sure if Spicy Monkey is gone or just taken over by Loop Soup?  They have many of the same sandwiches and make your own soup concept....in the same spot.  Still just as good, although I miss the 'Trust Me' grilled cheese with blueberry jam, that was probably one of my favorite items in the Market.",

I made a hefty purchase at Raw (their food will last for 5 days), I couldn't walk past Vanille Patisserie without making a purchase (they sell a cupcake with macaroons ON IT), and I picked up a pretzel from Ben's Soft Pretzels (delicious).

This is kinda like those.  It's an indoor space with a number of little chocolate shops, delis and quick food stands.  And although it is called the French market there are only a few French themed places.  I'd say it's more of an international market but that's nitpicking I guess. \n\nI'd imagine this would be really nice if you work in the area or you're waiting around for your train.  My wife made a bee line straight to Vanille Patisserie for their macarons. I can't lie they are amazing.  Overall, although there are a lot of little shops here, there wasn't anything that was super unique or would make me take a special trip to come back. If you're in the area though I'd check it out, or just take a quick walk west down Randolph to the Fulton market area.  Once you hit Randolph and Halsted you can basically throw your shoe and anywhere it lands is an amazing place to eat.",

To my surprise, I found that tucked away in a nondescript building under a bridge on Randolph and Clinton is a lot of really good food... \n\nDon't be fooled by the name: this isn't particularly \"French\" and it isn't really a \"market.\" If you are coming here looking for imported groceries, you are not going to find them. I would describe the French Market as more of a lunchtime food court with booths from all sorts of local restaurants. I am a fan of the diversity since you can try something new each time you stop in! Some of my favorites are Pastoral (sandwiches and cheeses), Beaver Donuts (awesome donut holes), Da Lobsta (lobster rolls), and Vanille (pastries). Where else can I stop in for lunch and grab a duck confit sandwich, bubble tea, and a macaron?\n\nIn the back of this large space, there's almost kitschy French cafe-inspired seating (umbrellas indoors for effect?).

The turnover is pretty high. Just in the last month or so, three stalls closed. There's no place here that serves a decent coffee since Lavazza left. It appears to have morphed into a lunch food court, because few places are open for breakfast in the AM, and many places are out of things by 5 or 6 pm, the time many of us would be boarding the train to return home. \n\nSaturday used to be bustling but so many vendors stay closed and now few people wander in that day...it was dead the last Sat. I was there a few weeks ago. \n\nThe planners of the market have somehow missed the boat.",

Well it's probably because its sole purpose is to cater to the west loop business folks, but still a great little treasure chest of delicious eateries very worth checking out. I had organic smoothies, butternut squash soup, barbecue pork and a bowl of poke all under one roof! A bit hard to find parking (like I said they're audience is mainly the walking-west loopians), but I was lucky enough to find a spot right outside on Clinton. I stopped by to check out Aloha Poke and found so many other awesome tings!",

You can basically get breakfast, lunch, and dinner here. There's everything from smoothies to handcrafted sammiches to fresh seafood and meats you can buy and take home to prepare a meal. The market is huge. It's best to take a walk once around and see what tickles your fancy (which will be a lot) and then make your decision. And it's hiding right under the trains at Ogilvie: great if you take the Metra and need something delicious; just take the stairs at the middle of the platform.

            "description": "This place is OK.  In Indy there is a place just like this (City Market).  Most every city probably has a similar establishment.....\n\nChicago's French Market is not as big as it may appear on their map layout of the complex.  There is a pretty decent variety of vendors in here but I did not really feel like any of them were doing anything extraordinary.\n\nSome of the stalls were out of daily specials by 1245pm on a weekday so that kinda sucked....\n\nI had a bahn mi from Saigon Sisters and it was ok.  Not really memorable, but it was better than many other misses I have had with this type of sammy.  The service was fast.\n\nThe raw food stand in here is all prepared food which I thought was annoying.  If I wanted to buy something pre-packaged and made in advance I would go to a vending machine or something.  Obviously, you can't find good raw/vegan food in any vending machine, however I kinda though the idea was that these little food stalls prepare your food when you order it....\n\nMy biggest problem with this place is the parking.  On the official website for Chicago French Market, they advertise that you can get 1 hour free parking in the lot down the street if you validate your purchases to $20+.  Fine.  They ALSO say that you can park in the same lot for the day for $14 if you want to stay past an hour.  When I pulled up to the lot specified, the attendant completely denied the $14/day deal saying it doesn't and never existed for the lot and the most I would be entitled to was a free hour with $20 purchase from the market.  NOT COOL.\n\nThis place is across the canal/river so its a little more west of the loop.  If you can make it over here, I think a lot of the food inside is better than most of the lunch choices east-ward toward Michigan Ave.  I don't think anything in here is revolutionary but it is a nice option to Subway or Panda Express.",

Especially recommended are Pastoral, an artisan cheese, wine, and sandwiches cafe, Fumare Meats for well-executed Montreal-style pastrami, a nice little tea shop named Bello Tea (which has some hard-to-find teas by the cup), and Little Goat, the small sibling of Stephanie Izard's Girl and Goat, with its especially nice salads.  More mediocre eats include Lafayette (Cajun - just ok),  Klay Oven kitchen (fairly good, but nothing-special Indian), and Da Lobsta (maybe it's just me, but I don't 'get' the lobster roll thing).  Seating is at a premium on weekday lunchtime - get there by 11:45 am or after 12:45 pm.  \n\nThere is a very interesting crowd there - many West Loop and finance industry workers, a few random commuters, and always some very expensive-looking young women  who overlap the former categories to an extent, but who otherwise you would not typically see in numbers in most West Loop eating establishments during the day.   For eye candy, the only place I know of nearby that compares is the Protein Bar on S. Franklin.  \n\nOverall, a great place to stop if you work in the West Loop, or happen to be in the area, but not necessarily a 'destination location'.",

But man oh man did I discover someplace special, I mean wow I feel like every vendor has something unique and amazing to offer. So far I've tried almost everyone in the space;\n\n-Fumare Meats is delicious, probably the best pastrami I've ever had and I eat a lot of Manny's so thats saying a lot\n-Freiktoken (not sure how its spelled) but the french fry stand with different dipping sauces is a great snack. \n-Juice Loop has some great stuff, I never thought a green drink would taste so delicious and be so good for you\n-Pastoral has the most friendly employees, need a good stinky cheese and dry red wine? These guys will hook you up\n-Flower shop has a great selections, my wife can attest to this\n-City Fresh has a good selection of groceries, many European brands you can not regularly find everywhere.... well maybe Marianos... but still great stuff and really friendly employees\n-Poke place which is new I guess has great flavor, first three times I tried it out the line was too long for my liking but last week at 2:00pm I snagged some tuna on rice deliciousness in less than 10min\n-Da Lobsta has great stuff, a little pricey, but still well worth trying and good for take out.\n-Vanille has my favorite pastry (aside from Beavers) a chocolate filled almond croissant!! So bomb I usually buy 4+ whenever I see them in the display case\n-Black Dog Gelato has a must try before you die \"caramel cashew goat cheese\" gelato that changed my life\n\nI could go on and on, seriously some amazing and top level establishments in this place, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU CHECK THEM OUT!!",

It's especially nice when it's cold outside.\nThe absolute best part is the belgian fry stand. You get a monstrous cup full of deeeeelicious chunky fries, and there's like, 15 sauce choices.

Offerings include:  sushi, fantastic salads, tacos, raw food, indian food, Korean food (sorta), Lebanese food, Vietnamese banh mi sandwiches, kosher fare, juice/smoothies, bakeries galore, and some very delicious crepes.\n\nThe grocery store also isn't bad.

They bill it as a tribute to European food markets, but it's more like a version you'd find in Disneyland than in a city that also has Frontera and Girl & the Goat. The ceiling is low and it's mostly dark colors, bizarre for a place inspired by the bright vibrant colors of fresh produce and sunshine filtering through tall windows.\n\nIt opens at 7 but that's a farce. More than half of the vendors don't open until 10, so three stars is really the most I could have given them (what was open didn't earn the max possible). I came expecting to get breakfast and maybe even pick up some food for lunch, but there was almost nothing available when the market as a whole opened. Even the places that were open didn't have full menus or only started serving until after I had to leave. It's like saying I can borrow your car at 3 but you can't give me the keys until 6.\n\nI had a crepe, it was good. Better than a mall crepe, not really remarkable either way. There was nothing open to see there and the building itself isn't very welcoming, so I left.",

ALWAYS. \n\nYou can walk in on either Canal or Clinton - it's actually connected to Ogilvie. Not sure what to get? Don't worry. I often find myself taking a lap around the perimeter before deciding. Something will surely catch your attention. If you're desperate for a hangover cure? get a greasy Pastrami or some Belgian Fries. If you want the best sandwich you've ever eaten and you're willing to shell out a couple extra bucks? stroll over to Pastoral or Little Goat Bread. If you have a sweet tooth? check out Vanille Patisserie and grab some macarons. But even better than all of this is you can grab some produce, meats, or fish to bring home and cook for dinner.\n\nI can't rave about this place enough.

Turns out it was just a more pretentious version of a food court. Located inside a busy railway station, this market was lackluster at best. We went for breakfast, which it turns out, is not a good time to visit. 2/3 of the vendors weren't open and those that were had very bland options. We ended up eating at the crepe place which was fine but nothing to write home about.\n\nThe overall feeling of the market area was a cramped mall food court that had donut stalls and sandwich shops instead of McDonalds and Wendy's. The lighting, layout, and overall ambiance did not encourage us to casually browse, linger, and enjoy our time there. Instead it said \"Get your food and be on your way!\"\n\nPerhaps I had too high of expectations but if Chicago was trying to create a place for small food business to reach a diverse customer base (like European food markets work) or trying to create a tourist attraction (like Chelsea Market in NY), they would pay a bit more attention to the aesthetic appeal of the space.",

While French foods do dominate, there is also Thai, Asian, American, and Italian (amongst other!) influences as well. \n\nAfter taking a lap (with an expresso in hand from Lavazza Expression...che perfecto), we decided on ordering a few different items from different businesses and sharing them. We ordered a lobster roll from Da Lobsta, a fig and brie crepe from FLiP Crepes, macaroons from Delightful Pastries, bread from Little Goat Bread, and frites from Frietkoten. \n\nThe lobster rolls was buttery and had a generous helping of lobster. Definitely would eat that again. The crepe was okay; I would have preferred to have had the crepe \"dressed\" while it was still hot on the grill so the brie could melt a bit and mix with the fig spread. It become increasingly too sweet since the flavors didn't really meld. The macaroons were heavenly, and the nice guy even gave us a free one since we had to order extra to meet the $5 credit card minimum. We tried everything from blackberry to lemon to chocolate to almond. All were so, so good. The frites were exceptional -- fresh potatoes cut and fried freshly with a variety of different dipping sauces. We just had the traditional mayonnaise, and we were still swooning over them. \n\nWhile we were there, there was a free wine tasting in the seating area by Fritekoten, which was nice. We enjoyed a glass of Beajoules Villages while eating our food. We took the bread home for a treat later.\n\nWe bought the broccoli & cheese bread from Little Goat, and it was spectacular. Toasted with a bit of butter was a perfect morning pick up.\n\nThis is a great spot if you are on the train and can home off to grab a quick dinner to take home, or a nice place to visit with a few friends and share a leisurely lunch. I really enjoyed my visit here.",

I think too many people miss the point of it being a \"French\" market in the sense that it is primarily locally produced/local shops, with Euro-leaning sensibility, and is an open-type market located in an urban metro...like the ones you see in Europe...like France, Italy, etc.  No, there are not 60 stalls filled with crepes, baguettes and brie. Really folks who complain show their own ignorance in that regard.  So, maybe a better marketing name should have been \"local urban market,\" so sue them for creating a bit more ambiance by calling it \"French Market.\"  Ugh.  It seems this place loses one full star rating due to people complaining about the name and expecting to see it overrun with mimes in striped shirts or something like that, I don't know.\n\nAnyway, I do take down one star for much of it being over priced. The grocery items you can find at other markets for less, so not really that appealing for daily staples.  Great if you commute through this station, or are in the neighborhood, and want to pick up a sandwich, lunch or special treat.  Forgot someone's birthday today? Stop here before heading into (or home from) work for a gourmet something or other treat for your friend, boss....or spouse (there is a stand with fresh flowers)...yeah, this place will save your bacon in a pinch.\n\nWhat is worth the trip if you're not just passing through - - bakery Delightful Pastries great sweets and best quiche in town, Oh Olive! balsamic and olive oils, FliP crepes, Fumare meats, and frankly just supporting all of the local small businesses that have a presence here.",

Although I don't really see what's French about it. Perhaps the way it's set up with various little shops and getting a bite here and a bite there. I had heard of it for quite some time and finally had the pleasure of going through it on Monday. My friend and I made a full lap of everything before starting our culinary dive into all the cute little shops. There is a lot of cheap street parking nearby if that's how you venture there otherwise it's right under the train station. Oh how I wished I worked or lived right by here so I could pop in for some tasty treats or a quick lunch.\n\nThey sell some produce at great prices plus have tons of great food spots like Saigon Sisters, Raw, a pasta joint and a korean place (there are many more I can't think of off the top of my head).

The filet mignon was $14.99/lb, which is on par with Jewel, and it looked a whole lot better too.\n\nI was able to score some oranges for $.10 each and a huge package of basil for $.99, so there are definitely good deals to be had here.\n\nIf you go there after work as we did, you might be lucky enough to sample some of the items vendors are selling. We got to try a Belgian beer and some raclette while we waited for our train.\n\nI've also visited a few of the food stands, and the pommes frites, while expensive, were delicious. You can also choose from a Vietnamese sandwich, crepes or even pasta if you so desired.\n\nIf I took the Metra home, I would regularly stop here on my way home to pick up fixin's to make dinner.",

We tried some frites at Frietkoten Belgian Fries & Beer; the fries were okay, not great, but I liked that they had several dipping sauces. Bello Tea has a good selection of loose leaf tea although service was a bit slow. Abbey Brown Soap Artisan makes lovely candles and soaps, which made the perfect souvenirs. And you can't beat that they have Little Goat and Pastoral there for some amazing sandwiches! I absolutely adored the Chicago French Market and wished we had one back in San Diego!",

They clearly state on their web site and in any other marketing that it is a European style market, where they focus around a transportation center and bring in numerous independent stands.  if you're expecting the food to be French, that seems to be your fault, not theirs...\n\nI LOVE the selection at this place.  The fries from Frietkoten are some of the best in the city, Saigon Sisters is always good, and I could eat the Montreal pastrami from Fumare constantly!  Combine that with some great deserts, fresh donuts, tea, coffee, and more you can build yourself the perfect lunch!  Then you have the general market goods, seafood, fruits, vegetables, bread, cheese, olive oil, etc.  It seems some people are complaining about the pricing, but for me, the pricing seems perfectly good for the quality of the food.  Can you get cheaper food, certainly, but this isn't the place to go if you're just looking for a cheap meal, but I would say most of the things here are a good value.",

The \"novel\" items like cheeses, meats and jams could be found in grocery stores or in other places around the city if you know where to look or know what you're looking for. Don't get me wrong, you have a ton of high quality variety here but its expensive and just okay tasting. And this is nothing like a French market in France and this place is barely French themed. Its more like an American take on what a French market would look like kiosk-style for touristas.",

Head over to Pastoral for their awesome cheeses and breads.  Want something soothing on a rainy, cold day? Go to Spicy Monkey to get a grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup -- both done the way you like it. I like FM because of its variety, and because it is indeed many steps above any other food court.\n\nNow, just because this is the \"French\" Market, do not expect Michelin star quality food. I deduct a star because nothing completely knocks my socks off, most of the items are over-priced, and this place is insane from 11 AM to past 2 PM",

For lunch we both had savory crepes then we walked around the loop for a few hours and before getting back on the train we had dinner,  This time we tried this incredible pulled pork, Belgium fries and an awesome deli sandwich.  We took a strawberry crepe home for later.  I also sampled a quiche that they were sampling delicious! The entrance is totally unassuming but once you walk in it's just amazing.  We were there twice in a day and everyone was so friendly. The crepe stand actually remembered what we had ordered for lunch and at that time of day it was crazy busy.  By the overall atmosphere it's nice to see there are people out there who still enjoy their jobs.  The only downer is that it's not opened on Sundays a few months back I was at the flower show and sadly the French Market wasn't opened.  Many of the food stands close early and are not open for dinner Who needs Taste of Chicago when you have the wonderful gem under the train station",

I mixed my lunch with select items from different vendors so I could have a larger experience. Then I had to experience the bevy of sweets. I was stuffed, but happy. \n\nI visited here twice in my three days in Chicago. I now wish I had more time to experience each and every vendor.

So I hopped the bus from Michigan Avenue and spent my time trying to decide what, exactly, I'd choose first. I loved that I could wander and no one was in the aisles, hawking their stuff yet everyone was pleasant and helpful if I asked a question.\n\nI was curious about the bahn mi sandwiches at Saigon Sisters, but couldn't decide which to order. An adorable woman came out from behind the counter and chatted with me; she eventually suggested the Hen House. I wasn't going to get that, because I wanted a REAL bahn mi, but she convinced me. And it was so good! \n\nI also enjoyed a crepe and took some pastries to go. It was pretty empty when I arrived but filled up right when you'd expect the lunch rush to start. There was plenty of seating and I was able to park for just a bit to enjoy my sandwich and read. \n\nI wish that this place was around when I lived in Chicago, it would have been a great place to grab something--whether it was cooked for me or ingredients for me to whip up something at home--on my way home after a day at work in the loop.",

It doesn't have to only be within Chicago ones, say like if they could invite a few that many people usually have difficulty patronizing(i.e. some of the vendors at Andersonville's farmers market, or the ones at Evanston and Oak Park), it'd be even better.\n\nNegatives and how this place could potentially improve aside, I did try the Belgian frites place out(won't even try to spell the name), and it was great. Not as expensive as some of the other places I saw inside here(i.e. Indian food place that was a little past Saigon Sisters), and that was good. I'd like to try Fumare and Flip Crepes out, but I'm afraid it won't be as soon as I'd like till I return, due to the hours not being really good here.

All of the vendors were very personable and you could tell they enjoyed their crafts.\n\nI thought the set-up was perfect too. The tastings were done in a separate area from where you made your purchases, so it was a low pressure situation when tasting, meaning i didn't feel like I had to buy a product simply because I took a sample.\n\nWe ended up with quite a haul - meat from Utah, wine from Italy, and whiskey from Few, a local distillery (hoping to plan a tour/tasting there soon!).\n\nThey offered free parking for an hour with a purchase of $20 or more, but we found a great lot just down the block from French Market - $6 for a whole Saturday! \n\nThis is a fun place to go in the winter months when farmer's markets are scarce, and just as great a place when it's nice out. I believe this was the 3rd annual tasting event, and I'll be sure to head back next year for the 4th one!",

A veggie farmer for the sides, a butcher for the lardons, halibut (pricey, that fish monger), a lovely baguette, cheese from Pastoral for dessert. It wasn't cheaper than the grocery store and of that I am sure, but the quality was great and the location is convenient. I'm still a fan, and spring and summer crops will probably solidify that.",

I was fascinated by the market. Did it make me feel like I was back in France? Um, not quite, but it was an amazing concept and experience nonetheless.\n\nI finally understood where Saigon Sisters was located. Still, at $8 a banh mi sandwich, you've got to be kidding me. \n\nI ended up getting a sandwich from Pastoral. I ordered the blue pig n' fig, which has jamon serrano, Aderkase Reserve blue cheese, local fig and black tea preserve, whole grain dijon mustard and field greens. Sounds good, right? Unfortunately the bread is hard as a rock. I think I may have gotten a cut on the upper roof of my mouth from this. I wasn't very pleased. I liked the combination of ingredients inside the sandwich though. It was salty, savory, sweet, and down-to-earth. I loved it.\n\nEbs got us fries to share from a Belgium fries place, which I've forgotten the name of, with all sorts of sauces. It was pretty good. My sister loved it. \n\nReally, I wish I work closer to this area. I'd stop in for lunch (with Ebs, of course), and I'd probably stop in after work to do some grocery shopping. The place is like a foodie's paradise.",

It has some of the traditional aspects of an indoor farmer's market, but also provides access to some of the best restaurants, chefs, and food in Chicago via its stands.

My evil enemy Mr. Croissant was staring at me in the face earlier..but I didn't cave in. Maybe another time we shall battle it out...\n\nAnyway, I tried the banh mi at Saigon Sisters and some macaroons at Vanille Patisserie. I'll just review both places here...\n\nSaigon Sisters:\nPretty tasty, but overpriced banh mi. Tried their Sun Tanned Cow (coconut milk braised wagyu) banh mi and it was good. However, I don't think I'd want to come back to fork over $8 for it...I just can't do it when there are cheaper, just as yummy, places =\\ \n\nVanille Patisserie:\nMoving along, I split a Violet and Strawberry Lemongrass macaroon with Michelle and O.M.G. there was a party in my mouth! It was my first time trying French Macaroons and totally fell in love (damn you, Michelle! You got me hooked XP ). Slightly crunchy exterior, soft, melt-in-your mouth interior, sweet, but light and...and...you MUST try it if you haven't already. I liked both the Violet and Strawberry Lemongrass, but that hint of citrus in the latter made me favor that one more. Now...1.50 per piece is pretty expensive, but these little bad boys are worth every penny! Will definitely come back to try other pastries/more macaroons...Mr. Croissant...I shall battle with you next time, but you caught my eye with your dark brown, glossy exterior...\n\nAll in all, tons of cute vendors, a little bit overpriced, not overly noisy or packed, but this place was hopping on a Friday afternoon. Will come again to check out other vendors, but not going for the banh mi unless I'm absolutely craving one and I happen to be at Chicago French Market.",

The desserts/pastries looked absolutely delectable, and I will definitely be back next time for a pain au chocolat! \n\nI sampled goods from the roasted almond vendor and the raw food vendor.

I find the produce prices of the French Market to be ridiculously reasonable. At the time of this review, cilantro is 50 cents per bunch, tangerines are 10 for $1, ginger is $1.99 per pound (I bought a 2 inch piece for 8 cents yesterday), et cetera. I also go to Produce Express if the lines for City Fresh is too long or they're out of certain herbs. \n\nBeing on my way to and from school, the French Market is very convenient. If you ride the Metra, it's the perfect place to pick up snacks like fruit, chocolates and croissants and even pre-packaged meals for work. \n\nTo be honest, I find the prices of the non-produce items to be expensive. A chocolate chip cookie, for example, was over $2. Yikes. It was at Sweet Miss Giving's, and 100% of the profits go to the Chicago House charity. Pastoral has some of the best selection of cheese (with very knowledgeable fromagers), and high prices to boot. \n\nIt's sad that the French Market seems to be struggling. I think it's in a good location, albeit over the river from the Loop. I think it has a lot of potential in general, but the produce quality and selection here is just fantastic. I'd come here over Jewel and even Whole Foods any day for the produce.",

It's one of those places that I would go and walk around, but to really shop there is too expensive for me. You can go to Argyle and buy a Vietnamese Sandwich for half their value. Or go to a supermarket and buy produce for half their value. The other venues\\markets there are more gourmet and personally owned which is why their prices are jacked up, in my opinion.

            "description": "I just adore Chicago French Market.  What's not to love?  I really miss this as Atlanta doesn't have anything close.  It's set up as a true \"market\" of little stores that you can walk around, indoor, and buy fresh deli, produce, or prepared foods.  I always go to get the Banh Mi sandwiches, and have gotten macaroons a few times as gifts for friends.  Love the little produce stand and the flower shop.  Want to try the crepes sometime, and I noticed a new Indian place too.  So it's not entirely french, but cute nonetheless.  Fun to meet up with friends and wander around for a more interactive experience than just meeting up in a restaurant.",

I've seen vendors come and go, and I think the market is in a really good place right now. I feel like it's \"filled out\" lately and feels more vibrant and inviting. I love stopping by there for lunch, coffee or a snack, or to pick up something to cook for dinner--or even to just walk through and see what's happening. The meat/seafood options I've purchased have been really good quality, and the produce has been pretty good too. \n\nMy favorite lunch options are probably Bowl Square, Pastoral and Saigon Sisters. The Mexican place makes decent tacos and the sushi place is good too. The Raw place makes great stuff, I just can't bring myself to spend what they're asking.  Vanille makes awesome macarons and croissants. And I love Lavazza! I'm excited to try the Indian place and the new soup spot. I LOVED Sweet Miss Givings and I'm really sad they closed. I hear they have some big things in the works, so hopefully we'll see them again somewhere soon!\n\nMy main gripe is all of the disposable plastic floating around that place. I wish there was a \"dine in\" option with reusable dishes, and/or use of more recyclables. My only other complaint is that some of the prices are a bit steep.\n\nAs a neighbor, I do feel like it closes too early on Saturdays, and it would be nice if it were open on Sunday. But, I know Saturdays are pretty quiet there and Sundays would be too, so I guess I understand. I'm really happy the market is here and I hope it's a fixture in the neighborhood for a long time to come!",

I don't work or live particularly close by and only went here for macarons from Vanille (apparently the only place that sells them that isn't way north!), but I somehow missed seeing the attendant booth before I parked and left for the market. Came back to find a note taped to my window to pay at the booth. Luckily, I kept my receipt and he was fine with that. Would love to stop by here again for food - everything looks delicious and it does have a quaint market feel. Beaver's Donuts is here too!",

But the decor could use more work. \n\nLots of interesting vendors, heavy on the eat-in foods (with lots of tables), sweets, and bakeries. Good selection of produce from multiple vendors. Seafood and meat selections reflect the lack of volume to support filling the display case with product. Plenty of patrons on a Saturday afternoon. That's a good sign - they won't be totally dependent on train station commuters. But I have my doubts how well this place does over time. I hope I'm wrong. \n\nAnd beautiful fresh French macaroons. Those I haven't seen in Chicago before. If you think chocolates are expensive, wait til you try these flavorful little bites, at $1.25 a pop.",

So much great food inside, not only produce and pastries but cheeses, meats, crepes, middle eastern food and Vietnamese food!  Saigon Sisters is amazing, try their bao combination plate (on Saturdays only) it's to die for and Flip Crepe has the best original crepe I've had in a long time.  Vanille has amazing French macaroons, supposedly on par with Laduree!  Their fish looks amazing and is pretty reasonably priced!

But will give you a unique and intriguing spin on finding a quick bite in the Loop? Oui.\n\nI'm actually surprised at the backlash here. I thought this was a great idea. It's 'French' in the way that little French markets offer a plethora of options, from a bite to eat to fresh produce to a relaxing place to kick back and sip on something bubbly. Check, check, check.\n\nPlus, with really tasty vendors serving up above average food, what's not to like? Saigon Sisters' tangy, zippy sammies, vegan/raw bar for you crunchy folks and the Belgian style frittes and bier stand... awesome. I feel like there's a little something for everyone here, which makes it a great place for coworkers to flock to for a different type of lunch hour away from the office. \n\nThe space itself is unique too. It's a little hard to find way down under Ogilvy station, but the adventure of seeking it out is part of the fun (and the location by the train platforms actually gives it more of that continental feel). Despite being 'underground,' the space is open, bright and cheery. \n\nAnd the little old accordion player is the coup d'gras in my book.\n\nSo overall, no, spending an hour at the Chicago French Market is not going to replace watching the sun set over the Seine, but it is something different and special--a happy departure from the usual same ol' same ol' of Loop luncheons.\n\nC'est le Yelp.",

The market is my #1 place to kill time if I miss my train and have 20-40 minutes to fill.  In the market you will find a little bit of everything. There's fresh produce, deli goods, beer, wine, artisan meats and cheeses, french pastries, cookies, cakes, vietnamese, japanese, american...so many options to choose from!  The market is more of a sight to see than a full on market/weekly shopping destination.  I'd say this is a great place to pick up a bite to eat (to stay or to go) and maybe some snacks.  There is much to see and the selection varies, if you have anywhere from 20 min to a couple of hours to kill, this is the perfect destination!",

It's not.\n\nNow you can probably appreciate French Market for what it truly is: A glorified food court bringing Loopy Lunchers good food all in one location.\n\nNow we can continue.\n\nI rarely step out of the office for lunch (I'd rather brown bag it), but when I do, I want a goooooood lunch.  I'm so over all the places, like, right outside my office door so I took a stroll down to the French Market to see what was crackin'.\n\nYUMMER EXPLOSION.\n\nSo many options and I love it!  Sushi over there, crepes over here.  Pastries (lemon bar, holla!), sammiches, banh mi, fresh produce, candies, hot dogs, soup, salads... really, pretty much everything is covered in this arena.  Hell, even Chicago's self-proclaimed Sandwich King (Food TV's Jeff Mauro) came here to get his eat on.  I trust it.\n\nA rare craving for a tuna salad sandwich brought me to the Fumare Meats outpost where I indulged my gluttonous desires.  The sandwich was large and in-charge, super messy and utterly delicious.  Tuna salad can be dicey because I always fear too much mayo and an overuse of celery, but the recipe at Fumare is perfect.  The purveyor of Fumare is kind of a wacky guy that reminded me of a mad scientist.  A sammich with a side of loony.  I like it.\n\nSo basically you should come to French Market for a nice change of pace.  French?  Not so much.  Fun?  You bet!",

Almost very type of food you can imagine from fresh fish, two cheese places, fresh vegetables, at least two bakeries, Vietnamese, Mexican, a creperie, raw food stand, Sushi and a deli that was sublime - plus others that I cannot remember.\n\nWhy oh why wasn't this place around when I worked downtown just across the street six years ago?!?!?  The prices for everything were amazing!  You can get a delicious fresh made lunch with quality ingredients for about the same price that you would pay for the substandard dreck that you would get at a fast food joint.\n\nWhen we were there it was a Saturday morning just as a majority of the standswere  starting to open but we only had a banana and nutella crepe as we waited for Fumare Deli to open to try their \"Montreal Smoked Pastrami\" - their sign enticed us to wait.  And we are sooooo glad we did.  I have two words for it - MEAT CANDY!  OMG, I am drooling again right now thinking about it!\n\nWe will definitely be back, I just wish that it was closer to us (and that it had opened when I was still working downtown across the street)!",

            "description": "If I lived in this drab, faceless and quasi-industrial neighborhood, I would be thrilled to death to have this market close by, but as a destination, I think not. The variety of products, though not all French, takes you through pastries and actually many baked goods, French breads and cheeses, wine, a Vietnamese restaurant, and fresh produce. But the place itself has all the charm of, well. a train station. It is not located at the intersection of anything, so you don't have the excitement of crowds, people watching. The eating areas are not at all \"intime\" or quaint, or special like a real French Market.\n\nAlthough I knew there  was no Burnham make-no-small-plans kind of inspiration found its way into this project, I had expected something more of an escape, ambiance-wise from the emptiness outside. I can't help thinking of Pike Place or Granville Market in Seattle and Vancouver, and how exciting it is to just go there and spend a few hours. I still long for that kind of real open market here in Chicago. Oh, well. Even if indoors. \n\nI poked around here, decided not to eat lunch in the bus station-inspired eating areas. I did spend some time at Pastoral, the cheese stop, and got some wonderful advice and a couple chunks of fromage there to take home. But I can go to their other more charming store on a quaint block of Broadway in Lakeview. Can't imagine making a trip back here unless I suffer from amnesia, and somehow wander into the area again. Or if I find myself taking Metra downtown.",

            "description": "I'm lucky enough to work in the same building as the French Market, and it is honestly the best thing to ever happen to lunch! There are so many great places to eat and over the past year I've only seen it get better and better.  You enter to a more traditional \"market\" setting where you can buy drinks, produce, pasties, and breads but then it opens up to at least 25 food vendors.  \n\nSome of my personal favorites:\n- Little Goat Bread: New to the French Market, this place always has a line, but it's worth every second! A satellite location for the diner on Randolph, Little Goat bread has some of the best sandwiches I've ever had.  The shrimp is by far my favorite, but the tuna is also awesome.  They add interesting twists to the sandwiches by adding ingredients like cheeze-its. Althought I've never gotten the bread, the muffin I got was out of this world.\n- Soup Monkey: Grilled cheese and soup, can't go wrong.  The soups are either pre-made (like clam chowder) or make your own with tomato or veggie broth bases.  You can add cheese, pasta, rice, meat, vegetables and more.  This is the only soup place I'll actually go to on a regular basis in the entire building.  The grilled cheeses are also great-- the caprese is my go-to, but every now and then I'll get the Trust Me.  Although cheese and jam might not sound like the best combination, it's awesome! Plus the staff is great!\n- Pastoral: Again, awesome sandwiches, but I go here for the cheese. Although there are other places with bigger selections, the staff here is awesome about helping you find exactly what you're looking for.  \n- Sushi: I have no idea what the sushi place in the French Market is called, but it's great sushi (especially considering it's under a train station!)...but be warned, you'll be waiting a hot minute if you order your own rolls over the pre-made ones.  \n\nBiggest piece of advice: Go early.  This place crowds up fast at lunch hour and stays crowded for awhile.",

Here's my personal tour de French Market...\n\nFor the sandwich lovers, hands down, my favorite was the MONTREAL STYLE sandwich!! (Located next to \"Pastoral Cheese\".  Simple, hot sandwich.  OHHH, SOOO GOOD.  Warm, tender, chunks of PASTRAMI between 2 slices of rye bread. Eat it with a side of yellow spicy mustard. Gone in 60 seconds. ;P (not created in Montreal, btw. The chef made up the name cuz he liked it:)\n\nNext up..Bahn sandwiches at Saigon sisters-I sampled the VBQ  & Hen House.  VBQ was featured in Chicago tribune.   i was not impressed. tasted too..americanized.  alluring me with it's waygu beef, but leaving me wanting.  The Hen House (chicken sandwich) was much better..watch out for those jalepenos though..hot stuff!\n\nBelgian Fries-tasty! comes with a couple sauces. i ate them plain.\n\nVanilla patassarie- i tried four flavors (red velvet, coconut passion fruit , chocolate, vanilla mousse.)  I decided..i am NOT a macaroon person.  too sweet!!  If i had to pick one, coconut passion fruit was the best.\n\nNow Gelato..YES, PLEASE! Check out Lavazza for dessert-Pistachio and Hazel nut ..mmmm...reminded me of Italy! \n\nOverall, cute atmosphere. Pricey for lunch (& groceries), but fun for quick bite or out of town guests.\n\nFun Fact:  The Market was Featured as one of the Top 5 things to Do in Chicago in the Tribune.",

Ogilvie was creepily deserted due the holiday, but the market was open.  \n\nWalking in I got the feeling the atmosphere they were trying to capture was like the Public Market in Seattle.

The vendor stalls were nicely set up though and offered a nice selection of wares.  There was a Pastoral cheese stall, a Vanille Patisserie stall, a fruit and veggie stall, Lavazza, meat and seafood, as well as various stands where you could buy ready made food such as Mexican, Asian, baked goods...even a raw food stand!\n\nBut the very best part about this place (and the main reason I am so very, very thankful I do not commute by train) is that they have a Belgian Frites stand offering amazing dipping sauces such as truffle mayo, peanut sauce and green chile mayo. The servings are huge - I saw a girl order a small and it was enough for two people easily.  Dangerous. \n\nThey do offer validated parking in the garage just north of the train station but I didn't know about that until I had already parked on the street.  Cute place all around, I would definitely return.",

Which is why I was overjoyed when I found out about this place, and headed over after work one day. Maybe because it was late in the evening, so there wasn't many people, and some of the food stalls are getting ready to close for the day. I thought Pastoral cheese shop looked interesting, and the seafood stall was well stocked, though I can't tell how fresh the offerings were since they were behind glass. Prices are actually a little cheaper than Wholefoods. Overall it reminds me of Chelsea market in NYC, not a lot of produce offerings, mostly cooked food, and not crowded enough (doesn't have the hustle and bustle of traditional markets). I wish they'd have more local produce rather than imported. The indoor setting make them a perfect substitute for farmer's markets during winter months, and would really set them apart from regular grocery stores. All in all, I think it has potential, but not quite worth a special trip yet.\nP.S. There's validated garage parking next door with $20 purchase, but on Thursday night around 6p there were also plenty of street parking. Right next to the pink/green line El stop.",

A big appeal of the FM is the atmosphere and experience--there's nothing else like it in Chicago. It makes for a great place to take visitors, or a great lunch spot when you are with a bunch of people with different kinds of cuisines in mind for lunch. \n\nPastoral is a great stop for cheeses and breads. Saigon Sisters rocks in the bahn mi department. And Karyn's Raw is a great adventure for those wanting a different take on food--I'm not vegan nor do I follow the raw food trend, but it's great to try something different. There are always plenty of samples about for tastings. \n\nWeekday lunches can be a bit chaotic, but there is plenty of cafeteria tables to sit and eat. Or, like me, if the chaos gets to you, get it to go.",

There's 2 or 3 French bakeries...and no one there speaks any kind of European language so when I order in French and you look at me like I'm crazy I have to look around and wonder where I am. There's a crepe place as well. It's a \"French\" market, but there's sushi, candles?? They need to rename the place the Multicultural center. It's always packed, it smells awful and after multiple trips I really don't recommend this place to anyone, it's really overpriced and a lot of the offerings simply aren't good or even European.

I was expecting something like Pike Place in Seattle or an indoor version of the Haymarket in Boston. It's not either. It's basically an indoor farmers market. Seems kind of industrial in my opinion. They definitely need to spruce it up a bit.\n\nWe walked around checking out the vendors and I was pleasantly surprised at the diverse selection of goods. Pastries, fresh veg, sandwiches, fresh meats and seafoods, and cheeses. Prices seemed in line, maybe a touch high. \n\nIt's worth checking out if you are in the area. It's a nice diversion and you have plenty of fare to choose from. Not sure I would go out of my way to go there, but if I'm near the OTC, I would go in and browse.\n\nCheers!",

There was one vegetable vendor whose items were a little over-ripe, so I stayed away from that, but everyone else's wares were great.  \n\nYou can pick up amazing cheeses (foreign & domestic), olive oils, a variety of pastas, Italian coffee & gelato, vegetables & fruits, sausages, breads, and so many tasty chocolates & desserts, your head will spin!  There are also several options for eat-there items, including sweet or savory crepes, pizza, sandwiches, and ridiculously-good Belgian fries with dipping sauces.\n\nI was surprised that it was as affordable as it was; granted, I decided NOT to pick up that small Apple-Rosemary jam bottled by a little old woman in Italy in her home kitchen for $15.  There were some pricey items, but most everything was not as expensive as I had anticipated. \n\nIn general, the market is a little small, and I'd like to see it grow, to include even more vendors.  But it's a good start. \n\nIf you're hankering for a taste of France/Europe, and like the feel of those type of markets, the Chicago French Market is the place for you!  (and me.)",

BECAUSE THERE'S NO WHERE TO SIT DURING LUNCH.

That said, when you first walk in, they do a good job of giving you a half-decent market. But why did I rate this place so highly?

The French Market doesn't quite fill that need: there seems to be a heavy focus on prepared food, which is fine provided you just need a good lunch place. (Also an expensive lunch place. $7 for banh mi? I know we're downtown, but come on.) As a vegetarian, I would have a hard time assembling interesting dinner ingredients here - I'm better off at Harvestime. (Although there is a lot of amazing-looking cheese at the French Market that you can't find up in Lincoln Square.)\n\nBut, you know, the market will grow and that problem may solve itself. As long as people FIND this place. What is a French market?? I commute through Ogilvie, and I had NO idea what this was until I looked it up on Yelp. I saw all the signs hung up around Ogilvie and the West Loop, but I thought it was, you know, a French market. Where they sell French stuff. Imagine my surprise when I realized that it was Chicago's attempt at a market like the ones I enjoyed when I lived in Los Angeles and Ireland! (And then my inevitable disappointment when I actually went in and looked around.)\n\nI can't be the only one with this problem. There are so many people in that area, and when I visited - around 4:30 p.m. on a weekday, when Ogilvie is packed full of commuters - the place was totally deserted. That, combined with a bunch of empty stalls, made for a sort of depressing experience. Again, I would love to see the market succeed, and maybe it just needs more time. I hope so, because Chicago could use a place like this.\n\nI'm keeping my fingers crossed for you, French Market, but I am not getting my hopes up.",

Might the \"French Market\" be a misnomer?  \n\nWell, I'm not French, and I've spent about all of three days of my life in Paris, but to me it really DOES resemble a European market inside of a transportation hub. (Speaking of transportation hub, heck you Ogilvie riders have it made! That's like the glitziest, most gleaming public transit space in Chicago. Union Station is like a McDonald's rest stop by comparison.) So why wouldn't all those North Shore folks wet their panties when they heard about this new market offering organic produce, artisan cheeses, freshly baked breads and pastries?  \n\nIt's just not enough.  It's not an effing supermarket where you can get all your Target brand, jumbo-sized, 24 packs of zero calorie, flavored-water-needs met.  Riiiiight.  That's because it's a FRENCH market.  You pick up the stuff you need for tonight's dinner, not for little Madison's Jonas Brothers themed birthday party next month.  \n\nThe food I tasted was solid.  For $6 the green rice bowl at the Korean stand was scrumptious.  Not $36 scrumptious.  But delightfully $6 worth of satisfaction.  Crepes, Pastoral cheese and meats, fresh squeezed fruit juices, gelato.  I beg to differ with some of you yelpers; it's a large selection, in maybe not the most elegantly lit showcase.\n\nThe best part-- the fresh fruits and vegetables are actually cheap!  Yes!  (Although cheaper than Jewel, Dominick's, and Whole Foods isn't surprising.)   Huge, bright red tomatoes under $1 a pound.  Avocados 2 for $1.  Fresh, juicy Sunkist oranges for I dunno but cheap 'cuz all that was about $5-6.

It was a huge indoor farmers market with a ton of vendors that I didn't know what to do with myself. Naturally, I was a wee bit excited to hear something similar was opening up in Chicago.\n\nThe market is located in a part of Olgivie Train Station I didn't know existed until now. Uh, I'm not much of a train rider. I got a bit turned around (don't ask, but thanks Yelp map for getting me back on path). Anyway, the place wasn't as big as I thought it would be but has enough to see and eat. \n\nMy first stop was City Fresh where I got some vegetables and steak with chimchurri sauce for dinner. It had a great selection of produce, meats, and seafood. I'm not much a cheese person but the vendor across from City Fresh had plenty of it, which my dad would probably enjoy. Then came desserts. There's much to choose from. I read previously that Sweet Miss Givings is the place for red velvet cupcakes. Unfortunately, they didn't have any at the time, but I chose a brownie (still to be consumed) and a mocha from Lavazza for the road. The dining area is a little small. Luckily, it wasn't crowded. I snagged a table to munch on my chicken tostada from Buen Appetito Taqueria before I left. \n\nI believe the Market added a couple of new vendors recently, and I hope to make many more trips back to see how (and if) big this gets.

They have a variety of food options like picking up an incredible sour dough loaf from Little Goat, Montreal pastrami (OMG), Beaver's fried doughnuts covered in Nutella, pulled pork at Lillie Q's, and some Lavazza espresso. Definitely, I would go back if I'm in the area.",

Fun selection of small shops (patisserie, cheese, bakery, grocery, meats, vegan, raw), but the atmosphere seemed a bit dreary. Maybe because there were a few empty stalls or not many customers at the time. \n\nCool idea though, and convenient location.",

I went with friends before the Opera on a Friday night and it was perfect.  Crepes from Flip Crepes and walking around looking at all the different options was the perfect start to the night.  Easy going, not crowded, good/ interesting selection.

There was plentiful open seating for the public and the tables and chairs were all very clean as well! The was a good assortment of different food, cuisine, and other items in the market.  They have cheese, wine, a florist, baked goods, chocolate/desserts, clothes, bags, organic food, raw food, crepes, as well as different cuisines (Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, French, Belgian). Prices are very reasonable and the market is easily accessible by the CTA (Green line).  I tried Raw, Saigon Sisters, and Flip Crepes. Everything was so yummie!

My mom, sister and I visited one Saturday and happened to be there when they had a tasting fair occurring. \n\nThis is truly a wonderful Chicago attraction-though it can be a bit hard to find. We took the train to the city, then when getting off the train, we turned around and walked towards the tracks. It may seem like you're heading nowhere, but a staircase appears in the middle and will lead you underground. \n\nThe Chicago Market is full of great vendors- fresh pasta made to order, organic produce, a patisserie, gelato and coffee, crepes, a florist, chocolatier, Korean, Belgium fries with truffle mayo, raw food, and more. \n\nThis is a great place to come do a bit of grocery shopping (if you live in the city), or grab lunch. We enjoyed lunch from Saigon Sisters- I had a lemongrass chicken banh mi which was delicious. My mom and sister both had rice bowls. \n\nI can't wait to go back and try other places.",

            "description": "Last month we were in the midst of New York's Chelsea Market and I lamented \"Why doesn't Chicago have a market like this?\"  or Zabar's for that matter.  Little did I know that French Market has been opened since December!!!  December?!  We made our first sampling of their goods from Pastoral Cheese which we brought to the Ferris Bueller movie showing.  Yummy.  A mushroom brie and chevre with whole wheat sourdough?  Yes please!\n\nThis morning we took the morning to explore the whole market.  Yes, everything is new and sparse.  Yes, some of the items are a bit heavy on the pocket.  Yes, it won't compare to Chelsea or London but to have a French style market(which for the lady who reviewed and didn't understand why there wasn't more French foor there.)where instead of the superboxes that carry everything you encounter different vendors that specialize in their particular wares i.e. cheese, meat, flowers, pasta, etc.  We walked in around 11am and there were a few people milling around but the market was far from crowded.  As we sat and ate the area seemed to have all woken up and walked over.  \n\nHere is where we visited today - \n\nSaigon Sisters - I have to give it to these ladies(and gentleman) but their $8 Frenchman sandwich with mustard seeds, duck,  candied kumquat and jalepeno.  I am not a sandwich girl but this concoction may change my mind.  By far Saigon Sisters and the Pastoral Cheese counter seemed to be the busiest locations.  Look for their restaurant opening soon on Lake.\n\nFasta Pasta - How can you go wrong with Portabello mushroom ravioli with a vodka cream sauce?  Just on price. ;)  Premiums items pumped this dish up to $11!!  Good? Yes.  But a pricey lunch item for sure.\n\nJuice Bar - A standard strawberry banana smoothie.  All fruit.  Good price but Jamba Juice on Halsted still has my dollar.\n\nLavarro - Finally gelato for dessert.  They have a nice coffee bar inside Ogilvie.  The hazelnut and limon were generous portions and more than enough to satisfy my palate.\n\nPapardelle's Pasta - what an array of fresh pasta!  I am so excited to try their different mixes of orzo.  Today we got porcini mushroom linguini with marsala cream sauce with champagne mushrooms.  Very excited to try these and the vendor had nothing but praise for the sauce.\n\nCity Fresh Market - has the primo location into the train station and takes up a large portion of the entire market.  They have a large offering of produce, meat, fish and pre-made selections.  Asian noodles for me as well as varied fruit and veggies ran me a measly $7!!  Who has nectarines the size of your fist for 99 cents a pound anymore?  \n\nAll together one of my new favorite spots.  20 bucks spent on lunch there and another 20 to make dinner tonight.  There is still a lot of room for retail and restaurants galore.  I hope that it will continue to thrive and grow.  Definitely a good spot to browse on a rainy day like today!",

I think once the rest of the plans for that area come to fruition it's going to be awesome! \n\nYou can get everything from fresh produce, to fresh flowers, wine, cheese, coffee, desserts, lunch and a ton more. \n\nMy two reccomendations are Papardelle's pasta. They have a billion dried, flavorerd pastas. I bought the lemon-garlic fetuccini and cooked it up that night. The lemon flavor really came though! I cant wait to make the whole wheat toasted onion papardelle pasta. My other favorite was Gramp's Pickles. Free samples-a-plenty! Try the horsradish pickles. They're like nothing you've ever tried...probably...but what do I know about what you've tried. I havent made it yet but it was suggested that I use the juice to make bloody marys. In fact, the juice for bloody marys is soooo popular that they sell jars of juice only. How about that?",

However, for anyone who has been to any kind of market in Europe, you will be disappointed. None of that market atmosphere is here. Shame on you for calling it \"French\". \n\nNow that the \"hype\" has fizzled (that was quick?), this place was totally empty when we visited. The stands are a little sad looking - almost like the goods are there to be on display, not actually purchased by customers. \n\nCFM is also extremely difficult to find. We looked all over Ogilvie for ways to get there and only when we were walking on the platforms where you board the trains did we see the signs that lead you down the stairs. \n\nThe only redeeming thing about this place is the big Pastoral corner. Meats and cheeses? Yes please!",

When you go to the Ogilvie station for a Metra ride, you can now head downstairs (by the trains, not the food court area) and be treated to very high-quality produce, meats, patries, wines, cheeses, nuts...you name it.  I particularly like the frites place with genuine Belgian style French fries.\n\nI like this place so much that I am concerned about their really poor marketing and advertising.  I'm worried they will close if they don't get enough business.  What they need is sampling stations where vendors can let people in the station try the products and then provide CLEAR directions for where the French Market is located.  The signs they have now are almost invisible.  They also need PHOTO boards showing people what's down there.  C'mon...it ain't that hard.",

Wonderful storefront, neat and professional, worthy of all the covered markets I visited in the past.\n\nSevere review, I know - but sometimes you need to be stern to see improvement.

There's such a variety of stands and I love that most are local vendors.   Shop local when you can!  \n\nI stopped by one of the bakery stands and am now enjoying a locally baked Danish.

I was really glad to see Canaday Le Choctier was here! Pastoral which offered samples of their cheese fudge, which was like eating a piece of cheesecake. A really awesome artisan bread shop. A bakery or three, and slew of lunch spots. I really like it because a few of the vendors would otherwise be a huge hassle to get to, me being a south side person and all. Vanille for example, now doesn't require me taking four hours out of my day to pick up something sweet, instead I could take the half hour or so trip here! \n\nNice place, I really don't understand all the backlash.

Everything looks and sounds so wonderful!\n\nWe decided on frites at Frietkoten with curry mayo and some ketchup to just have something 'normal'.  They were wonderful!  Though they took forever to come out of the fryer.  They had four fryers and each one holds an order?  Seemed odd, thought perhaps it's different during the rush periods.  \n\nThe produce was a bit scarce, but hey, it *is* January.  Some things aren't meant to grow right now.  Pastoral as always looked busy, so I'll stick to the Lakeview one by me with the tinier time.  The raw bar looked scrumptious and the Saigon Sisters had some awesome sounding sandwiches.  \n\nAll-in-all I think it's off to a fantastic start!  The butcher could use some work instead of being mainly deli meats.  I mean, if the tiny Andersonville market can have several meat choices on hand, I think this big one could do so as well.  I wanted some cornmeal and saw none which was sad.  LOTS of bakeries which don't raise the score any for me.\n\nMost places take credit cards, and if they don't the front entrance has one for you!  It's out of my way to get here, so I don't know how frequent I'll come in, but I think that for starting out, this place looks GOOD and my pocketbook will be thankful I never come around this area too often because those Wisconsin cheeses looked goooood!",

Did I add they aren't actually Macaroons in the Jewish sense? These are Parisian Macaroons. There was a place called Delightful Pastries, and they deserve a major shout out for awesome food at substantially discounted prices.

Many great food finds: pastrami from Fumare meats, Belgium fries, macaroons, grilled cheese, goat cheese from pastoral to name a few.  This is a great spot to pick up a sandwich for a picnic or outing on the lakefront. I'll be sure to return again!",

            "description": "Any number of not-so-major cities seem perfectly capable of sustaining a meaningful food market: Milwaukee has a cute one; Cleveland's is even better; Vancouver has the best one on the continent. But Chicago? We just don't get it ...at least so far. \n\nWhatever high hopes are contained in the concept of a downtown market are quickly flailed by the atmosphere: fluorescent, quiet, lifeless--more loft space than gathering space. What sounds tasty on paper is vanille in execution: Whole Foods without, you know, people. This place seriously needs a spark--let's hope growing season brings a farmer's market into the space. Anything, please.\n\nThis is not to say the offerings are in anyway subpar, for Saigon Sisters is turning out a nice, slightly upscale pork belly banh mi, and Pastoral has good salumi and cheese on offer; Lavazza ensures a decent cup of coffee and gelato can be had. But you expect something special at this price, and yet CFM has no sense of place or reason for being; it is quite disconnected from the neighborhood--of which I'm a resident--and offers no compelling reason to become a regular (which is what they'll need to make it). It's telling that the Market has gotten very little press since opening.\n\nYes, it needs some time. But I'm still skeptical.",

I'm also the dope who gets a kick out of pronouncing and spelling the word \"French\" as \"Fronch\".  Just had to throw that disclaimer out there.\n\nAnyhow, I went to the Chciago Fronch Market to meet my friend Jared who was hanging out there allowing friends to trickle in and out throughout the day and wish him well before he left to teach in Saudi Arabia.  It was actually an ideal location for something like this because he could hang out in the cafe and read while he waited for people, but once someone showed up for a bit, we could walk around and look at things.  \n\nSo when I got there, we made a few laps around the place before I decided to start shopping for food. I enjoyed a few phenomenally delicious chocolates from the chocolatier, then got to finding dinner food.  I was very impressed by the pasta stand there with all the flavored dried pasta, and left with both red onion and basil infused pastas.  Then moseyed over to Pastoral where I found some old-styled craft beer (note: do not confuse with Old Style, not the same thing) where they use spices instead of hops, and some crusty bread.  The bread was a bit too stale but that was my only beef.\n\nI also got some fresh veggies over at the produce stand and then just bounced around with my bud for awhile before saying goodbye.\n\nThe resulting meal, while a bit expensive in its entirety, was incredibly delicious and I was very fond of the beer.  While there may be some Fronchier Fronch markets out there (probably in France, I'm guessing with my super genius skills), I had a good time at this one.",

Since it's kind of off the beaten path we decided to drive and park in the garage.  The garage is very dark and you park yourself.  The attendant insisted that I give him my keys even though I was in a parking spot and the garage wasn't full.  That made me a little nervous.\n\nIf you're looking for lavish pastries you're in the right place.  Being that we're both on diets we passed on those.  There's several booths which include fresh fruit and vegetables, ready made food, cheeses, pastas, sushi, gelato, and a GORGEOUS meat counter.  The prices on the meats and fish seemed really reasonable and I would definitely go back for that.  There's only a few places in the city that you can buy live lobster and The French Market is one of them.  You have to spend $20 to get free parking and since all I bought was a small coconut gelato (heavenly by the way) we had to pay $14 for the half hour we were in there.  The French Market is definitely something to check out but if you drive go wanting to spend $20.",

I guess it was somewhat dead when we stopped by for a quick bite after work, but it appears to be a work in progress. The mural of the Eiffel Tower at the seating area is a fun touch, and it is good to see a variety of semi-upscale food vendors that is a step up from the train station food courts nearby. We tried out the spinach and feta burek and the liquid yogurt from CityFresh Market. The burek was not bad, but perhaps it was an end-of the day burek and was not as flaky as it could have been. Still, I look forward to a return visit to check out some of the other vendors.",

When you have those days when you're not super hungry but still have to eat coz we love eating and your taste buds cant decide - French Market is your cure. Options and we all love them. From Italian to Belgian - they've got you covered. Its a fun experience to walk through the market, pick a few items to taste and do your groceries all at once. \n\nWe tried the veggie Vietnamese sandwiches at Saigon Sisters. I can't say I loved it but I'd go back for more. Fixed our sweet tooth from the Italian gelato place. \n\nThere is something for everyone! Its a great place for an indoor picnic during the cold wintery days in Chicago :-)",

That is all I need to say. \n\nSeriously, though, while people complain that French Market may not be as sophisticated, cheap, or full of variety as other, more established farmer's markets around the country or even the world, it's trying and it's only the opening week.\n\nI stayed away from the more upscale bakeries (ahem, Vanilla Patisserie, anyone?), and got a honeydew for $2 (in the winter!). A bag of fingerling potatoes for $3. $7 for a pound of giant, domestic shrimp, which the fishmonger packed in ice for my bike ride home. Some of the scallops were literally the size of my fists. And I found POLE BEANS, which I love love LOVE and haven't been able to find around my neighborhood. \n\nI do hope that as they work out the kinks, we'll get more variety and maybe more vendors, but for now, I will happily return for my Danish bacon from Fumare and other grocery needs.",

We're spoiled by having two very new, big box grocery stores right near by (Dominicks on Halsted, Jewel on Desplaines)...and the French Market is the perfect cherry on top to find those great extras that make meals a little more special. \n\nThey have a great assortment of stands, and I've been particularly impressed with their cheese and bakery selections. We sometimes have a little wine and cheese before dinner, and every cheese we've selected has been high quality and well-paired (thanks to the great recommendations of the vendor).\n\nThe bakery is always fresh, and they have some great desserts, perfect to bring along with as a party-gift for the hostess. I've bought a boston creme pie, a kringle and kolacky cookies (cheese and raspberry) and all have been delicious.\n\nI have only bought protein from them once, and it was good but definitely more on the expensive side. I've also had a mixed experience with the fruit, some of which has been overripe. But as I said, for most things I depend on the other big grocery stores, and this is more of a place to swing by for your specialty items. And you can stop at Lavazza (yummmmm) and get a coffee before perusing the market!\n\nChicago French Market is a great speciality market, and it's especially convinient if you live in the West Loop.",

            "description": "It's not exclusively, or even primarily, a \"French\" market, if you look at what type of businesses are there. Other notable ethnicities represented are Indian, Vietnamese, and Italian. The aromas that you will notice in the air are cilantro and curry. Is this fact like a commentary on globalization? \n\nThere is a large seating area which has a panoramic painting covering the entire walls, which is a simulation of being inside a mezzanine level of the Eiffel Tower. In the background they play a mix of French pop and classic cabaret chanteuse songs on the sound system. \n\nAt noon on a Saturday it was not very crowded, just about the right number of people to make it seem lively, but not crowded and didn't have to wait long for anything. \n\nThe \"Belgian Fries\" at Frietkoten are basically what we would call \"French fries\", but they were pretty good, and they have a wide variety of dipping sauces that you can get with them. Tomato Basil Soup at Chicago Organics was not good, tasted canned and can't recommend that particular meal. \n\n\"RAW\", adjacent to the public space on the right, is fantastic, it is the new venture of one of the nation's leading raw-food chefs, and they frequently are offering free samples of their raw-vegan creations. \n\n\"Pastoral\" is a cheese, bread, and wine shop which is probably the most-French themed of any of the businesses, and does have an excellent selection.  There is a creperie, and there are several pastry / bake shops which have, among other things, some pretty good renditions of well-known French pastries. \n\nIn summary, it does not remind me of my travels to France, and the true francophile will be disappointed on that count. But it is a nice new place, and it's amazing that this is located in the Metra station. If you are going through that station anyway then of course you should go into the Market.",

We had a the duck confit sandwich from Pastoral and the curry beef and vegetarian samosa (clearly not French related) from Chundy's Bistro. All items were fresh and delicious. I just wish my stomach was bigger. We also purchase 2 pastries from Vanille patisserie, and they were absolutely divine. Will go to back from fresh, organic food selections.\np.s. The garage is North of the market on Clinton, and it only requires $20 combination from vendors for 1 hour (it is quite easy to spend that much quickly here).

            "description": "I was really excited when I heard that the Chicago French Market was opening. I was like, finally, Chicago is going to have a proper year round public market. The thought of farmers/vendors selling varieties of fruits and vegetables, meats with so many different cuts you can hardly choose, and fresh fish from actual fish tanks, kept me waiting with much anticipation.\n\nThen came the opening weekend. I couldn't believe what I walked into. \"That's it?\" I said to my mom. It's a tiny area, probably a third of the size of a regular grocery store like Jewel or Dominick's with a lower ceiling and narrow aisles. We walked past a bakery near the entrance selling unimpressive pastries. I was really hoping for a proper bakery selling bread, baguettes, croissants, or boules so fresh that I would walk 8 blocks every morning, even in the bitter cold, for breakfast. Nope, that's not gonna happen.\n\nThe next crucial staple of a good grocery store - a fish monger. While they look fresh, the seafood is expensive and I could pretty much get those anywhere in the city. There goes my hope for buying the catch of the day like many real fishmongers would offer. Chinatown can do better. At least they have seafood so fresh, they are swimming in a fish tank.\n\nOK, fine. Maybe the butcher could offer something better. They are in fact run by the same folks who sell the seafood. I was sorta expecting a big block of meat that is cut-to-order, you know, like what you would see in a proper butcher store like Gepperth's in Lincoln Park. But no, they are pre-packed like Jewel's for your convenience.\n\nOh, and the vegetables, they look wilted and dry. Fresh fruits and vegetables are quintessential items in a market. If they can't get that right, why am I even going there? Certainly, not for pho or Lavazza coffee.\n\nSo basically it's a big disappointment. We should probably get Green City Market their own market building.",

So I'll avoid piling on and instead focus on Frietkoten-- the Belgian frite stand.\n\nI've walked around the French Market several times since it's opened, hoping to pick up some frites for the train ride home.  Frietkoten seemed to be one of the most publicized features in the articles I read about the Market.  However, the space reserved for it was always completely empty, as if it could be months before we'd see it open.  I stopped by on New Year's Eve, and I was excited to see that it was open.\n\nThe basic menu is very simple: regular and large.  There are also a variety of toppings (spicy, mayo, ketchup, etc), but I opted for the \"standard\" order to see how it would compare to street vendors in Brussels.  After a decent wait -- it appears that all batches were made to order, nothing was sitting under a heat lamp -- they slapped on some ketchup, mayonnaise, and chopped purple onions.  My initial thought was that their \"standard\" frites should be served with mayo only, but the ketchup and onions weren't bad either.  The frites were perfectly crispy and served in a paper cone with small wooden forks.  I'll definitely return again, but I will opt for mayo only or 'spicy' next time.\n\nThey weren't serving beer yet, but they had two taps set up.  Apparently, they will be offering some Goose Island draft selections including Matilda.  Additionally, \"many\" varieties of Belgian bottles will round out their selection.  I was given an estimate of late February for when that will start.",

            "description": "Well, kudos to Chicago for tying to create a somewhat indoor market in a bustling, busy, no-time-for-anything city. But...I think I would like to come back when this market figures out what it's trying to do. \n\nAs I write this, the market has only been open maybe...2 weeks, so I expected things to be patchy and rough, but not like this. \n\nHere are the good points: I am a fan of anything sweet, so the chocolate, gelato, crepe bar, and pastry stall immediately caught my attention. I tried a small pastry and it was pretty good. I want to get some chocolate there sometime but then I think about the bad points and it hinders my wanting to go back. \n\nSo...the bad. It's a mad house at lunch because there are several stands that make fresh sandwiches, juices, soups, etc. to order so it seems all of the business people, tourists, and school groups that are in Chicago are gathered in this tiny space between noon and 1 pm all at the same time. I am not kidding. This leaves NO seating room at all, which is sparse to begin with. You would think with all the people jamming into here to eat there would be seats galore, but no. My boyfriend and I were forced to sit outside of the market on a dirty bench while people rushed to get to their trains and homeless people shuffled by.\n\nThe produce, meat, etc, is somewhat underwhelming. For the prices of fish, meat, hand made soaps, and breads that are sold here, I can get better at let's say...Whole Foods. The grapes looked like they had been sitting out for a day or two and I didn't really see anything that looked exotic or special. Maybe I'm being picky, or maybe we came at a bad time, but we left feeling like the food being sold wasn't anything we were eager to cook or eat. That, and the fact that there seemed to be hordes of teenagers pushing their way around and making sarcastic comments the whole time. Meh. \n\nAlso be wary of using your credit card at some of the places, since a few do not yet (or may never). There is an ATM at the entrance and at the CVS station across the hall, so they are your best friends. \n\nIt's still new, and maybe I shouldn't be so critical yet. So if I find my way down there again in the future, hopefully things will be a bit cleaned up. A part of me really wants this to work, because I really want to try those crepes.",

I don't think they are trying to be a large market like the Reading Street Terminal Market - only three lines are serviced through Ogilvie - there are 12 lines serviced through Reading Street Terminal.  \n\nAnyway, it is what it is for now - let's hope that some of these vendors beef up on what they offer.

If I regularly commuted into the city, I would definitely shop here often.  For someone living in the burbs, having the convenience of picking up fresh, organic food and a bottle of wine for dinner is a true time saver and the ultimate in convenience. Honestly, just that alone makes this worth 4 stars, as there is nothing worse than jumping off the train at 6pm and having to make a trip to a grocery store before getting home.\n\nAnd I was impressed at all the healthy options that are offered here at the Chicago French Market.  So impressed, I even wrote about it (http://tinyurl.com/y88qt5k) in my column for the Examiner.\n\nAt RAW, you can enjoy salads and raw entrees; their mint bar was delicious.  How often do you see a raw food place at a french market?  Not in the burbs, anyway.\n\nAnd Chundy's features some delicious Indian fusion food for carryout.  I tried several of his unadvertised dessert breads, which are made with all fresh ingredients, as well as his delish chicken salad.\n\nYou can get freshly squeezed vegetable/fruit juice for breakfast at Juicy Orange - your choice of unlimited ingredients.  \n\nAnd Sweet Miss Giving's alone is worth the trip - they donate over 50% of their profits to the Chicago House, helping the formerly homeless and HIV positive.  Their baked goods are pretty darn good as well!\n\nCity Fresh Market features Tallgrass beef, Amish chickens, and seafood.  City Organics has a good selection of organic produce at good prices.\n\nPerhaps if you live in the city, this is not that impressive.  But for the commuter crowd, Chicago French Market offers unparalleled convenience, a great selection of healthy and not-so-healthy foods, and wine and cheeses. Definitely worth my time!",

            "description": "I went to this market after seeing so many 4/5-star ratings, yuk! Let me rephrase: this place sucks balls. Immediately after I walked in, I noticed this place was ridiculously small. Next thing I found out was their fruits were nowhere close to 'fresh' like some people described. Actually quite a few of them were overly ripe, and fruit flies actually swarmed around them! Well that's an instant turn-off. I continued walking down the aisle, through the pasta, sandwich, meat and fish section, and none of the products even remotely intrigued me. Almost everything was so overpriced and trust me, 80% of the stuff they have here can be found in common grocery stores at lower prices. Before I left I got an ice cream cone 'cuz they looked about right. But guess what, it's 100% artificially flavored and tasted like a mix of syrup and sweetener.\n\nGross! How dare this place call itself 'French market'? Virtually nothing here is French!! As I walked out, I thought I might just enter a forlorn parallel universe where the French market had been demolished by the devil.",

            "description": "If you've been to another city with a large indoor market, you'll be pretty disappointed. \n\nFor instance, in Philadelphia, the Reading Street terminal market (another train station based one for apt comparison) is a large beautiful market filled with specialized grocers, bakers, pizza, butchers, fried chicken, baristas, and Amish farmers. \n\nThe Chicago \"French\" Market, which is a terrible name because there isn't any plethora of French food or styling, is small and filled with franchisees with a handful of farmers.\n\nThe farmers were done a huge disservice by premiering in Winter, although it does make sense given that it is an indoor market, but the real strategy is that Metra riders who are often from the suburbs are making pitstops that coincide with their trip home.\n\nThere are a couple of shops there that are good, but their stocks are lighter than I'd want. The butcher has a limited supply of meat without any special cuts or game that I couldn't find at a local Jewel (albeit higher quality) or a local boutique grocer like Olivia's. You're a whole butcher counter - give me calf's liver, goose, or Delmonico cuts!\n\nPastoral and Saigon are the only places with lines most of the time. Pastoral because they're the most infamous local purveyor of cheeses and charcuterie and Saigon because it's delectable Vietnamese food.\n\nThe chocolatier is pretty good. The sausage shop by Pastoral got stiffed bad on location! I didn't even know they made sandwiches, but it's a good alternative if you don't feel like waiting in line for Pastoral. \n\nI feel like if the hype hadn't been there and this opened up as a surprise, I would be blown away more. I will say however, that I'm happier that this is here than it not existing.",

Hopefully one day it will be as cool as Philly's Reading Market.\n\nThe brighly lit-up-for-the-holidays multi-colored trees in front were an indication it was finally open!  I had watched that darn Metra Market website and the Fulton River District Association's page for the last few years for news.  Finally.  \n\nI have to second the cured meat recommendations for Fumare.  I tried the Gypsy bacon.  Great selection of Eastern european meats.  Was listening to stoppers by searching for Croatian items, etc.  The staff was helpful and was offering up a few slices for sampling purposes.  I also grabbed a few organic grapefruits which were beautifully colored.  \n\nI will definitely be stopping by for the Tallgrass steaks from Kansas.  Grass fed is harder to cook but far superior in nutrition (higher Omega 3 versus Omega 6) and taste.  Nice to have a mini Lavazza coffee stand as well as the taqueria; there are some nice tables in the back with murals of the Eiffel Tower to hang out and munch.",

I may return on a weekend to grab a sandwich from Pastoral, as this place isn't far, but I didn't see much else that looked like it would blow my mind.  \n\nThe location of the market is a head scratcher.  It's in the north end of the Northwestern station on ground level.  I would imagine a lot of commuters race right by this place without stopping.  And on the weekends there can't be many people around.  Most commuters/weekenders seem to go out the Madison Street exit.  This area of downtown/West Loop is dead on the weekends.  I guess they are targeting the Monday through Friday office workers in the area.\n\nWhat would make this place instantly cooler would be decorating it like the casino area in the Paris Hotel in Vegas with the blue sky.",

Personally, I didn't let the name or the lighting influence the fact that I found numerous tasty treats, at reasonable prices, with friendly informative staff inside one venue.  That's a lot more than I can say for many of the grocery stores in this area.  \n\nI appreciate the local vendors and I enjoy supporting them.  I especially enjoyed meeting one of the owners of raw.  She was outgoing and extremely knowledgeable.  Anytime we were contemplating a product she was eager to pass out sample.  Meaning she stands behind her product and knew we'd enjoy it.  \n\nThe fresh baked breads, delicious assortment of cheeses and nice display of seafood are just the beginning.  The market also offers beautiful flowers, gelato, soaps and much more.  It's definitely a spot worth checking out.",

Now mind you I've been spoiled by the Queen Vic market in Melbourne (http://www.qvm.com.au/) so any market has to stand up to that.  Selection is somewhat limited, but you can find your euro basics here:  cheese, bread, wine, fresh produce.  It makes for a nice Saturday morning jaunt.\n\nThe fish didn't look the freshest, but that's merely my opinion.  It's nice they have a mix of prepared foods and groceries.  They do need more seating though, and I'd love to see some more Italian and Greek vendors.\n\nSo get a crepe from Flip, have a Red Velvet cupcake at Sweet Miss Givings and get some Glogg from Pastoral.

My favorite aspects in no particular order:\n\n- Little mom/pop style grocery stands: For this single twenty-something year old, it sure beats going to Dominick's.  The produce selection is greater and the prices pretty comparable.  Plus, all the vendors are friendly and answer any questions.  Apparently you can get green cauliflower from crossing a broccoli and a cauliflower - who knew?!\n\n- One of the stands sells Tallgrass beef - 100% grass fed, free grazing beef.  It's a can't miss if you're a steak fan.\n\n- Saigon: As a former Californian transplanted to Chicago, I've been missing Viet food.  This saves me a trip to Argyle.",

            "description": "I've been wanting to come here for the longest time and finally got to go this past Wednesday. I had heard Saigon Sisters was here and was looking forward to tasting their food and looking forward to purchasing some specialty items. I went into the \"free\" parking and was yelled at by the parking attendant who told me that the garage was full and I should've known it by the cars that were double parked. I promptly stopped him from continuing his yelling at me like I was his child. That exchange kind of dampened things for me and further when he told me that free parking was only available for an hour and after that it would be $20. I guess if you want to shop at the French Market you have to hurry up. Anyway, the choices seemed delicious for lunch but I quickly headed to Saigon Sisters despite sampling a delicious sandwich from a sandwich shop on my way to SS. I ordered the Beef Pho from the rude female clerk who could hardly crack a smile or speak a few extra words to tell me what they had. Her cold attitude and the parking attendant were enough to ruin my experience at the FM. I was seriously surprised at why she was so cold like I was bothering her for ordering my meal. When I asked her for my water she just waved her hand to the side of the beverage area without barely looking at me and she wasn't even busy. Anyway, the Pho was decent even thought the noodles lacked some flavor. I thought the food court was a bit dirty and we struggled to find a semi-decent clean table. The young man collecting the garbage also looked pretty unhappy and I wonder if it's perhaps not a very happy place to work? On my way out, I did stop at Beavers donuts and and they were delicious. When I asked about their gourmet donuts the sales clerk encouraged me to try their basic donuts which was a great suggestion although I don't understand why he discouraged the gourmet ones? All in all I don't think I'll be returning to the FM. I would rather try a more welcoming place. Like I said maybe the FM is not such a great workplace because the people I encountered seemed so grumpy and unhappy.",

At the same time, it was nice to have been able to stroll through leisurely without being bombarded by crowds.\n\nWe are excited to go back to visit and to see some of the changes and additions that have been made since our last visit, but at the time, a number of the restaurants and shops seemed out of place, inevitably detracting from the supposed \"French\" part of the French Market.\n\nThe prices are high, the merchants are friendly, and if you're looking for an all encompassing cafeteria slash// high end mall food court, then this is your place to be.\n\nFrom soups to sandwiches, from flowers to gourmet chocolates, Indian food to Vietnamese, they were all very delightful (especially that of their bakeries!) but at a higher markup, of course.

I went to the French Market on Friday night after work and it was indeed crowded and slightly difficult to get to any specialty merchandise. When you first walk in from the station, you're greeted with some convenience foods in a cooler and a bunch of way-overpriced (but HUGE) fruit. But I didn't come here for fruit...and definitely not at that price. I did see a seafood counter that looked promising; the Wisconsin Cheese Mart was also cool, and Pastoral...the Pastoral counter is the undisputed star of the show, and it's also the most busy. They're staffed about right, the prices are about what I expected, and the people are friendly. \n\nI would come back for Pastoral alone. Nothing else there really caught my attention and I was disappointed that so many vendor spaces - about 1/3 - were either empty or closed down way ahead of closing time. No one was sampling but Pastoral. Of the two places that appeared to be open to serve food (but I wasn't really sure), one of them had just burnt something awful, and the other was fully-stocked with counter people, just standing around. No food was visible at all in either place. \n\nTo be fair, the place just opened up last week and there are some definite kinks that still need to be worked out. One note: apparently they've figured out the credit card thing, at least at some merchants, as I used mine everywhere with no problem. I will likely venture back in another month or two, when hopefully there will be more merchants, better selection and fewer gawkers.",

I love that I can decide what I want for dinner on my way home and cook with fresh ingredients instead of planning out menus in advance and cooking with produce I bought days ago at the supermarket. The selection of produce and proteins is really good, especially considering the size of the stands. I was also impressed by the quality and the prices. Yes, things are slightly (only slightly) more expensive than at a supermarket, but I'm willing to pay more for the convenience and the quality. \n\nTo all the people complaining that it's not big enough, there aren't enough vendors or that it's not a \"real\" French market, we have to start somewhere, and this is a huge step in the right direction.",

Since I work in The Loop and one of my co-workers sometimes takes Metra, we decided to make a trip to CFM after 5 one day.  \n\nI ride the CTA, so I was initially impressed by the sleek building that is 131 North Clinton.  However, when we reached the actual market,  all my expectations of gourmet and fancy deflated faster than a pin poked balloon.  The place had the feel of a makeshift fair set up in a suburban, high school gymnasium.  I know it's a marketplace, but I felt like I was attending a job fair or some kind of trade show with multiple exhibitors.  \n\nWhile there was variety (popcorn, gelato, banh mi sandwiches etc.), most of the displays did not seem that unique or appealing.  Everything was pretty expensive.  One small container of pasta salad was about six bucks.  The medium sized, cheddar and caramel popcorn I bought for a pretty penny paled in comparison to Garrett's.  We sampled some bread from one vendor.  It was solidly good, but didn't taste like anything worth buying there. \n\nUnless you really need that bread or fancy cheese for your dinner with the Grundersons tonight, don't bother.  There's probably a Whole Foods nearby.  Heck, even Jewel or Dominicks will do.",

I am familiar with burek through my significant other who orders it on the regular. It is specific to his culture. I talked my friend into trying one, of which I had one bite. I should get a medal for sticking to my diet and not eating the whole loaf because it was bombtastic. \n\nNext, I purchased some meats from the meats counter....all grass fed and mostly organic...I was able to purchase 4 meats ground grass fed beef, grass fed beef and lamb chevapi, Amish chicken (which was confirmed free of hormones and antibiotics), and beef stew chunks for TWENTY BUCKS!! That's a lot if grass fed goodness for $20. Definitely cheaper than Whole Pay Check.\n\nThe cheese curd is delicious. They have some other tasty treats that I was unable to try but look yum! I want to try the juice bar.\n\nThe misses....the Raw Shop. I don't want to completely hate on it, but they were more expensive than Karyn's and that is hard to do. They also didn't have the nut pate - which I thought was standard raw food fare. Maybe I was spoiled by Karyn's. I will try again, though.\n\nPastoral Artisan Cheese's looks delicious, maybe it's only a miss based on pricing. Although, they are supposed to be the best of the best which explains the price. $32/lb for cheese....I am no expert, so to be fair I won't comment on what my gut level response about that one is.\n\nThere are so many places there. I will likely update this review once I have had a chance to visit more of them!",

This would have been the ultimate in convenience!\n\nFirst off, you can also do a bit of grocery shopping here.  It's definitely not going to take care of all of your needs but you can definitely get some of the basics covered . . .   And from local farmers as well.  The prices appear to be better than Whole Foods but, as with everything, your mileage may vary.  \n\nSecond is the main reason I like this place . . .  Usually when coworkers and I were unable to figure out or agree on what we all wanted to eat the Ogilvie fast food court won out.  Unfortunately . . .  It's all fast food.  This is a great alternative!\n\nI do expect to see it continue to improve as time goes on.  Right now it's the dead of winter. I'm really looking forward to seeing what the spring and summer brings for the vendors in there.  \n\nSo far I've tried three of the vendors for lunch.  \n\nRaw - GREAT food VERY personable staff.  My only comment is they have too many free samples out!  I went with a coworker and we tried each of the four samples they had out.  They were VERY VERY good but she was full from the samples alone.  I walked away with the Chicago Raw Rolls which were like vegan sushi rolls.  Excellent!\n\nBuen Apetito - Not thrilled.  I ordered a Chicken Taco and Tortilla soup.  The Chicken Taco was bland.  The Tortilla Soup was very tomatoey (for lack of better word).  Not bad food but I can go to La Cocina at Washington and Wells for better Mexican food.  \n\nI also got a turkey sandwich from one of the vendors . . .  It was good!  Not sure what the vendor's name was however.",

We picked up 4 different kinds of cheeses from the same very knowledgeable vendor that is also on Broadway in Lakeview (Pastoral).  Strange thing about this market it is apparently actually like France, so I'm told.  What I mean by this is that you pay at each vendor vs. walking through the market with your basket and then paying at the end.  Who knew?\n\nIn addition to the wonderful cheeses, we grabbed delicious olive and sun dried tomato tapenades, buttery soft prosciutto, apples, and avocados to go with baguette.... and we picked up the ingredients for bruchetta too.  A feast indeed. \n\nIt was delicious.  The cheeses were great minus the Brie, which kind of tasted like a dirty, camp foot, and the tomato tapenade was one of the star players of the meal.  \n\nThis place has an amazing fresh seafood counter so we are excited to try our hand at grilled calamari next time.  There is also a florist, a candy vendor, a raw bar, a sushi bar, homeade sausages, a pastry place (maybe 2?), and a couple of fruit and veggie stands.  Definitely a place go to over and over again.\n\nParking is validated if you spend $20+ dollars.  Just bring your receipt and ask the vendor to punch your card from the parking garage before you go back out to your car.",

It was different and very tasty.  We added a cup of soup, Italian meatball, which also satisfied the belly.  Next time we'll go for lunch we'll have to try some of the indian or was it polish - meat stews?\n\nOverall, I think it is a work in progress - as it still doesn't look done.

The last time, I made a couple of stops on Wednesday afternoon to some of the different merchants and walked away with some delicious loot! First, I had to buy some macarons. Vanille Patisserie, located at the train terminal entrance, is the only place in Chicago that I've found that can make macarons the way they are supposed to taste. Light, crunchy, flavorful, and unique, these macarons could even rival the ones that I covet from La Dur\u00e9e! There is also a Vanille Patisserie on Clybourn. Now all I crave is an Ispahan from a Pierre Herm\u00e9 or La Dur\u00e9e boutique in Paris. Looks like I might have to wait a bit longer for one of those, though! Next, I walked to the opposite corner of the market to the Pastoral Artisan Cheese, Bread, and Wine merchant. Their selection of cheeses is almost unrivaled. The best part is that many of them are so unique that I've never found them anywhere else! For example, I purchased a chunk of manchego cheese with a rosemary wrap around the outside. I also bought a goat cheese infused with anise and lavender. The flavors were light and fresh, perfect for summer. I'm in love. Although the prices are quite expensive, it's just a joy to treat yourself to some delicious summer fare once in awhile. Also in my grocery bag was a 1/2 lb. of Venetian Calamari linguini from Pappardelle's Pasta (I made sure to steer clear of the Habanero pasta so as not to repeat a dinnertime drama from last week). I'm planning on checking out Pappardelle's suggested recipes to see how to prepare the pasta. But if all else fails, I can always make a sauce with cream, butter, shallots, garlic, and perhaps some clams/clam juice? If anyone has any suggestions, I'm all ears! I'd definitely implore you all to check out this little slice of France in Chicago. It's pretty damn great!",

All of the vendors are so kind and the quality/pride people have of what they are selling is so refreshing. They are all so knowledgeable and willing to share--I absolutely LOVE this place!!!  The only bummer is like what other posters have said- sometimes a place you love just disappears without warning- like that sweet little french man who sold the BEST olives I've ever had.

            "description": "I love the Chicago French Market and would gladly tell you my favorites if I wasn't concerned about making the lines longer at my spots, but I can be of service to answer the question \"What is Montreal Pastrami and how is it different than deli pastrami?\" The guy behind the counter will answer the Deli uses Navel, we use brisket (as though that's something that would actually give you a semblance of an answer). So here it is, the Montreal 'brisket' cut is much much much fattier and less salty than the deli version you know love and can't find enough of in Chicago. Also, they serve it on dark rye, which you normally don't see at the deli, this is a sweeter rye. SO you end up with sweet bread, tons of slimy fat, and some good beef mixed in there somewhere. Also, they don't put the mustard on the sandwich for you, which is just something I prefer. I definitely won't buy this again, especially because there are so many other much much better options at the CFM.",

            "description": "I hate to bump this down a star, but I have to. For my purposes, the French Market just isn't cutting it.\n\nStalls may up and leave at any time - which happens, but it also happens generally without warning. There was a great organic Italian booth here... gone. And Necessity Baking is gone too.\n\nI'm bummed that it's hard to get out of here with a lunch that's under $10, too. I realize that goes with the downtown territory, mostly, but it makes it a less appealing option for me. ($7.50 for a bowl of pasta from the new pasta place is really pushing it.)\n\nWorse, the whole market is lacking that bustling activity - heck, any activity - that is the hallmark of other markets I've been to. The space remains soulless and character-free, quiet as a mouse most days, and not heavily trafficked. I think the location is doing it in, to be honest with you, and I wish that weren't the case.\n\nI'm sorry to say it, but the French Market is a disappointment. I wanted so much more.",

There's so many choices and they are all different from eachother....theres a crepe stand, different bakeries, produce stands, sandwich stands, vietnamese food stand, florists, and other unique stores/stands. Last time we had a couple croquette sandwiches from LM and an orzo salad from a produce stand....mmmmm so good.  Levazza is also there and they have good coffee and pastries aswell.",

            "description": "I'm ashamed that I've only just discovered this place.  I work along Wacker Drive at the UBS Tower, which is about a 3 block walk from the French Market.  I somehow have missed out on years already of what could have been delicious and nutritious lunches in an atmosphere that is as close to a French Market as you're going to get in Chicago.  The selection is great - there is a vendor representing about every ethnic food group.  I bought a delicious baguette sandwich with cooked prosciutto, brie, arugala (sp?) and sliced eggs with a mild and savory honey citrus viniagrette, and a Vita Coco to wash it down.  I'm very excited about the possibility of spending another lunch break in the loop at the market.  There is so much I need to try, and when considering the fact that one could potentially pick up ingredients for dinner while on their lunch break at this place, the conveniency factor is 5-stars as well.\n\nThe only down side is the seating.  It is far from any door or windows, so you are not able to sit and gaze at passers-by, or even anything too aesthetically pleasing.  It is sort of hidden away from the rest of the market at the back of the lot.  The location is also hidden.  I mean, I did not locate this place for years, and I work downtown.  It is at Ogilvie Station, but it's at the Washington St. Entrance to the station (apparently there is one), in a corridor behind the platforms.  Unfortunate that they are not allowed to use this spacious corridor for seating, as it would make a better arrangement to enjoy one's fresh foods.  I hope this place is able to attract the attention it deserves.  It is a short walk from the offices of thousands of Chicago workers - ones who would like a fancy feast, or also with under $10 ideal lunch budgets.",

For instance, I went in today asking about their special (which was basically a club for about $6-$7) and the lady behind the counter suggested a pastrami that they roast themselves.  Now, the pastrami was pretty damned good, but the sandwich was a bit small.  The shocker was when they charged me $12 for it.  Just a bit of warning: if you're going to upsell to the tune of a 70% increase in the price, you should warn your customer.\n\nSo, play it smart.  If they make a suggestion, ask in advance about the price.\n\nOther than that, their meats are pretty good (though the bread they use for their sandwiches is generally lame.  After today's shocking upsell, I'm unlikely to return however.\n\nNow Pastoral (right next to Fumare) is incredible.  They have a great sandwich including great meats and cheeses.  They're likely to get my exclusive lunch sandwich business from now on.",

Combining a market reminiscent of my old fave Fox an Obel and the sandwich styling of a Pastoral variety (there is a location here) sandwich shop. the market just keeps adding on the variety.  So far I have had a sandwich from the pricey but amazing specialty market next to pastoral (BBQ pork belly on fresh baked french bread mmmmm) and what is probably the cheapest option in the market, the Chinese place, that was also pretty damn good.  I have to make time though to try the Belgian french fry bar, that's right, nothing but fresh cut french fries, assorted dipping sauces and a variety of Belgian brews.  Thank god they are open till 8, I don't think I would be very helpful at work if I made it a lunch.",

They get off right in front of the best new breakfast/ lunch/grab a dinner on your way home venue in the Loop (at least according to me!). \nDuring a recent trip to Vancouver, I was absolutely enamored by the vast public market in Granville. The Chicago French market pales in comparison, scale, variety and crowds considered, but it is exciting to see the concept finally make it into the city. \nI've tried to make amends for not trying the place sooner by making a couple of lunch trips here. 2 trips, 4 vendors, sampling of apple-caramel crepes, Belgian fries served French style, fresh fruit juice and vegetarian Vietnamese subs - and I loved them all! \nA special shout out for Flips ( and this is not entirely to get a free crepe, their current offer) - great options, friendly staff, a bit slow - but hey, you can't rush those crepes. Saigon Sisters also deserves a stop - I was a bit reluctant to bite into a sub containing tofu,lemon grass and red pepper, but was really pleased with the end product. Next stop: the very enticing patisseries sprinkled throughout the market! \nHuge thumbs up for the French market - for anyone working anywhere in the Loop, this is a must try lunch destination.",

(i ended up here thanks to the later. we were also meeting at a nearby gallery, and there was a dearth of decent inexpensive dining options in the area.) i was particularly impressed with the variety of vegetarian, vegan, and raw vegan options; grabbing a (quality/nutritious) bite on the run isn't always easy for strict vegetarians. \n\nthe place doesn't have much to offer in the way of restaurant dining atmosphere, but it isn't a restaurant. don't go here if you're looking for a quiet place to linger over lunch.",

            "description": "I am a huuuge of the idea of the French Market.  It brings a lot to the city. Most big cool cities have one (or more).  But the execution of Chicago's version leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nZillions of people go to the Loop every day for work.  You'd think there would be a of variety in food to eat.  But there isn't.  The Loops is dominated with chains and fancier restaurants.  \"Let's get something ethnic - how's Chipotle?\"   Seriously??  There are only a handful of smaller vendors left.  The French Market gives the Loop an infusion of smaller vendors and ethnic food.  That's the greatness in the idea.\n\nWhen you enter the French Market, however, it's a bit of a downer.  The first thing you notice is that you're in the wrong part of the train station.  The main entrance is off Madison, where all the foot traffic goes.  The French Market is north of Washington St.   I bet most commuters don't even know about this side of the station.  The second thing you notice is the super bright fluorescent lights.  Yeah it's a small thing, but it makes you think this place is a food court, rather than an upscale market.  The dining area, floor tile, etc. add to the food court effect.  It just doesn't look like a place you'd want to hang out at.\n\nThe food itself is fine.  There is a great variety of vendors.  Pastoral is excellent.  I enjoy Saigon Sisters (though there is better banh mi around but far away from the Loop).  There's Korean food, crepes, Belgian fries, raw bar, coffee, desserts, chocolatiers... all sorts of interesting food to consume.  I would much prefer these places to the Subways in the Loop, not to mention the prepared food at Whole Foods.  The groceries are cool too.  Some people complain that these vendors don't have everything, but c'mon people - these are just small vendor stalls!  It's nice to be able to get fruits and veggies for less than Domnicks & Whole Foods prices, within walking distance.  It's nice to be able to get fresh fish and fresh meat.  Yeah I could drive up to Stanley's to get veggies even cheaper, or I could go to the full fish market on Fulton/Halsted.  But having all this stuff here is a great convenience.\n\nAll in all, I'm very happy the French Market is here.  They could really give it a facelift to make it cooler.  And maybe just rename it to \"Metra Market\" - like the signs outside the building for the last 5 years - would make it less confusing to some.  Lately I have noticed that it's not terribly full during the lunch rush.  Not a good sign!  I hope the market stays afloat.  Today, the Chicago French Market is nowhere near Faniuel Hall in Boston or the various markets in Toronto.  Heck, it's not even as good as Milwaukee's market.  I think our market has a lot of promise though.  It may unfortunately require some churn to get it to where it should be....",

I tried a smores crepe, which was really good, and really big.  It's more like a smores burrito, definitely share with someone, don't attempt this one on your own.  Other than that, I know there is Pastoral and Vanilla Patisserie, but both are slightly expensive, and the portions are not very big.  As a market, I don't think it compares to other really good markets, but if you are already in the area, then I think it's fine to stop by.  I wouldn't make a big trip out to the French Market, though, not worth your time.",

            "description": "After reading the reviews, it appears folks are approaching this place from two camps: those looking for a quick meal--i.e. lunch--and those looking to buy things for making a nice quality meal at home--i.e. en route home after work.  The market is definitely worth repeat trips for having a meal.  However, where this place shines and shows how it is special is in the areas of fresh produce, fresh meat/fish (organically, grain fed meat/poultry, great section of fish), and variety of cheeses, high end deli, wine (Pastoral), and deserts. \n\nWith respect to the dining, I have only eaten at the deli on site (very good to great but not cheap). My wife loves the Vietnamese noodle dishes and crepes. \n\nI think folks should be happy to have this place; it's akin to similar stuff available to commuters in world class cities--Grand Central Station, NY and Paris subway.  If you use the Metra, you should definitely make a trip over here en route home. You can pick up a high quality item to add to an otherwise routine dinner--whether it be fish/meat/poultry, a side dish, a great bottle of wine, or dessert. \n\nThis place is truly a benefit to Chicago, the train station system, West Loop and urban living in general. I would avoid the reviews trying to compare this place to a large chain supermarket; the two places are apples and oranges and the comparison is not helpful or meaningful.",

Having been to a variety of markets all over the country and in Europe, this seemed nothing more than a small sampling of a Whole Foods or a plain Dominics.  The variety was minimal, the sitting area was like a school cafeteria and there was virtually zero atmosphere.  It is understandable that we are not in the midst of the Midwest produce season, but it was still rather sad.   Pete's Produce can pull it off very well this time of year, so why this place cannot is beyond me.  I know that Chicago is capable of supporting a far more impressive market and I hope it develops into something bigger and better, but the limitations of the space itself will probably prevent that anyways.",

Many of the stands were either bare or had no one working and the few that were open, most of the employees looked like they could care less about being there. I didn't get the feeling of a French market with people chatting with the booth owners and other shoppers. The selection of meats, cheeses, and breads wasn't that impressive either.

Yes, in some ways it does have a European feel.  However, after being there probably ten or more times, I'm not too excited about it.  First, its really out of the way if you spend your time on the lake side of the loop (though parking isn't hard, but who drives downtown?).  Then, once you get there, seriously the prices are on par with jewel and the selection not that much better!  Yes, its nice to have pastoral, but there's a pastoral in the loop.  Yes, I do like the belgian beer and fries place.  Yes, I do like Vanille Patisserie (although there's one of those closer to my house anyway), but really for what you get, it's not worth the trip.  Plus the ambiance is heinous.  Really, really bad.  Florescent lighting, metal chairs... it feels like a cafeteria.  A badly lit cafeteria.  I don't like spending time in there at all.  Also, there's been a ton of turn-over with several of the vendors.  And once when I went there, it was to celebrate some French holiday, maybe Bastille day, and there was a singer belting Celene Dion in the common area.  No thanks, not even on Bastille day!!",

I've been trying to get around to all of the vendors and try something new each trip, but I'm only about a 1/4 of the way thru.  \n\nI started with City Fresh Market and couldn't help but continue to return for their tuna salad. It's an ample (take-out) portion size in the $5 range.  I've also had their turkey roll-ups, pasta salads, and fresh produce/meats.  This has been very convenient for me to pop in, grab lunch or dinner and go!  \nAnother favorite of mine is Saigon Sisters.  The Porky sandwich is nothing like I've ever had before.   I highly recommend this one and I look forward to trying more items from their menu.  \nI still frequent Pastoral because I'm in love with their cheese selection.  They also carry pate which I purchase on occasion.  \nThe fresh squeezed Orange Juice from (I think it's called) Juicy.  I've been there three times so I should know by now.  the first time I purchased a small o.j. I drank it so fast I regretted I didn't buy the large one. I've also visited the Organics & Necessity Baking.  \nSoon, I will make my way towards some places catching my eyes - The Belgium Fries place, the pickle guy, Raw, Zullo's and Papardelle's.  \n\nThis Market carries fresh, high end products and usually the owners are serving you.  (Most of the sandwiches are about $6.  the produce prices are comparable to any other store.  Cheeses are priced at exactly what I'd expect and the desserts I've seen are gorgeous and priced right)  Everyone is friendly and ready to answer any of your questions.

The market is a great eclectic selection of fresh foods (read: yuppie...and yes, I am one of the chosen few, so it's OK to use the word), especially some great pastries and sandwiches.  We went on a Sunday morning and I settled on a lunch of Vietnamese Spring Rolls and left feeling full (in a healthy sort of way), cultured (that's right...these ain't your momma's fried egg rolls), and ready to visit the Art Institute (that one's unrelated to the goodness of the spring rolls).  Spring rolls aside, definitely sample some of the cheeses from the various vendors - my favorite was the chocolate cheese (it's exactly what it sounds like...delicious).

            "description": "A step in the right direction, but a long way to go.  I am a fan of Pastoral, so it is worth stopping by just for that.  I have yet to try Fumare, but it looks promising.  It certainly is convenient to be able to pick up fresh produce on my way home. There's too many bakeries (and that's after one of the bakeries pulled out at the last minute). And some of the food stalls were either out of food by 6pm or have not yet opened at all.  Food stalls need better signage for their menus.  I have been so looking forward to the opening of this market, but unfortunately I am disappointed.  Clearly not all stores were ready to open by December 3rd.  And too many bakeries.  Oh I already said that :-).",

We found parking on the street and paid for it before we saw a sign that said free parking if you purchase $20...too late...oh well. So I've been wanting to try bahn mi and pho from Saigon Sisters and that's what we got. Bad choice! It was the worst bahn mi and pho we have ever had and we paid $25. Never again! As for the rest of the market, it was pretty dead except for Pastoral. So next time...if we are in the neighborhood, we'll just go to Pastoral and maybe try the meat place next door too.",

            "description": "When I choose my food, I like to patronize the knowledgeable purveyor.  I like to have my questions answered about where my food came from and how it was prepared.  I like the reassurance that the food is fresh and is not preserved by chemical treatment.  Whole Foods does a good job of having people who can answer questions and make this information available, but the cost is prohibitive.  You can get this information from the farmers at the Farmers' Market, but in the bleak midwinter I'm not so willing to make the trek.\n\nThe French Market has a number of really terrific purveyors.  Lots of other reviewers sing the praises of Vanille Patisserie and they are correct.  These are the best croissants I have had in Chicago and I am addicted.  The Fumare Meats counter is another great place to shop.  This guy really knows his product and offers samples and advice.  His Irish style bacon is great and I have never seen a product like this anywhere.  Necessity Baking is outstanding.  They have bread that has not been overworked by machines so it has a wonderful body and a great crust.  One day I buy a decadent cheese bread and when that is gone I alternate with one of their delicious whole grain loaves.  Everything I have bought has been spectacular.  Produce Express (which runs down the center aisle) is terrific and they either label or can explain to you the origin on all their products.  They also have a daily supply of fresh herbs most of which are $1.50 per bunch.\n\nLet me say I have not been disappointed with any of the vendors I have tried.  I don't buy much prepared food so I have only tried the Flip Crepes (the dessert one that is the cheapest) and that was very good.  They wrap it so it was still warm when I got it home.  The Delightful Pastries carry pierogi that you can heat up when you get home.  \n\nMany reviewers are using their reviews to brag that they've had the authentic Euro market experience and this isn't it.  It is not Paris - what it does share with the European market is the small purveyor who is in touch with his or her product and has a passion for what he or she is selling to you.  \n\nI am thrilled that I can stop at this place on the way home from work and get fresh veggies without having to go to a supermarket.  I don't know if it would be a destination for me - I would make a trip to visit the Fumare Meats.  I think this is his only shop.\n\nI hope this business thrives and grows - there is plenty of empty retail space in that part of the station.",

            "description": "I walk over to the market at least 3 timer a week. I always end up getting something for lunch, or I purchase some produce from City Fresh Market, depending what they have that looks good that day. I am however tired of orderimg sandwihes or soups only to get back to my office and find out that I paid for an $8.00 loaf of bread with nothing in it, or my soup is in a small coffee cup for $3.00. I am willing to pay the high price, just don't cheat me. On my latest trip there I ordered fried clam strips, I was wondering why they didn't taste of clams, only to find out after breaking several of the strips open, that there were no clams in them. I was eating fried breading.The people that work in the market are very friendly and helpful, but the people managing  those stalls are cheating the customers. My guess is that the rent there is astronomical, and you might as well save wherever you can. I'm done getting ripped off.",

            "description": "This is a great location for a place like this. I love that there is tons of street parking available around here on the weekend. They validate with a $20 purchase I prefer the street. Good meat selection and really reasonable prices. Fish selection was really nice too and veggies were cheap! I really want this place to succeed. I always have problems deciding what to eat at places like this. Vendors were really, really nice and helpful. Why isn't this place open on Sundays? If anyplace should be open on Sunday this would be the place. I suppose they are going for the work crowd but they should think about people like me who will only find themselves here on the weekend because the hours make it impossible to get to during the week. I found a hot sauce I've been looking for today and was pretty happy with myself. I am going to go eat the pasta salad with feta that I bought right now. Nice price for it too...only 3 bucks. Oh yeah, and free meat and cheese samples....that's always nice.",

            "description": "Not really all that impressed with this place after all the hype. Some good things at the pastry and candy places, but everything is SUPER expensive at them. I've eaten at both the crepe place and buon appetito (Mexican) and I thought both were pretty gross, with the exception of the Mushroom Brie soup at the crepe pan. I found the Mexican place to be awful, and they couldn't bother to add the two items that I requested AND paid for to my food??? Also find it quite strange that they have a cheesy carnival food stand with caramel corn and cotton candy, but okay. The grass fed beef filets my husband bought for $30 last week were just \"okay\", but  certainly not as good as local restaurants who charge much less for the prepared version. My mom requested that we bring her some white chocolate bark from the candy place. . .it was $36 per pound and not that good. Its really disappointing considering that there had been so much hype about this place for the past few years, especially since we live in the immediate area. Maybe I will have a better experience here in the future, but from what I've seen/had so far, its just not that great. . . also a HUGE disappointment that the market is closed on Sunday.",

            "description": "So much hype for so little.\n\nThe market is still only partially full, and the selection is seriously redundant. The prices are high. Some vendors do not take credit cards. The ATM machine in the market was off (or not yet hooked up) this morning. It opens at 7:30 (a bit late for those of us who are commuters, and passing through the train station much earlier than that), but NONE of the vendors were ready then, and I was sorry that I milled around, waiting half an hour for it to open this morning. The guy at the crepe place actually waved me away because he was on the phone - won't be going back there (Crepe Cafe on Clark is a good bet, though! Try them - they're great). A guard followed me, commenting on my meandering while I looked in the cases (two cheese places? four bakeries, two with nearly identical cookies? a closed coffee place, closed mexican restaurant, and two closed asian restaurants? a rude crepe guy? WTF?)\n\nSeriously. This market needs to get it together. I understand that they just opened, and that at 7:30 in the AM they've just opened daily, but maybe they aren't ready. Period.  \n\nIf you open at 7:30, be ready then! Trains are bringing in morning commuters much earlier than that, so an earlier opening time is probably wise, but if you don't have it together by 7:30 - seriously, no one was ready to sell me anything when I got there this morning - then what's the point? \n\nThis could be a great place, if they did it right. I hope they pull it together. And, I hope that they start opening earlier, and are ready upon opening. But, I won't gamble by waiting on them again. Not worth it.\n\nTwo places in the area that offer a unique, European experience, with great customer service and commuter-friendly hours?  Hannah's Bretzels on Washington and the Crepe Cafe on Clark. I hit both on the way to work this morning.",

            "description": "I love this place and I'm always looking for an excuse to get over there. We've found it to be a great place to shop and prepare for a special meal when guests are coming over. The meat vendor is one of the few places where I have found grass fed beef (which has just about ruined all other steak for me) and they have an excellent seafood selection as well. There are wine vendors, pastry shops, cheese stands, produce vendors and cured meats shops as well as lunch options including Vietnamese, French, Belgian, and raw food. Prices tend to be a little high but the quality makes up for it in addition to supporting local / sustainable / small businesses. I think it's a fun little area to wander around in - every time I go back, I find something new. The free garage parking with purchase also makes it convenient. The vendors are also super-friendly - more than once, we've been given more than we've ordered or an extra cookie \"just to try.\"",
