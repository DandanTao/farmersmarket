            "description": "A gorgeous late September Sunday morning and cocks are crowing... somewhere in Indiana. HA! \n\nBut on this morn, we Funksters are in Wrigleyville with the Red Line rattling the window panes as our AM alarm clock. Coffee, bagels, cheese, fresh fruit and Uber are the order of the day.\n\nWith the aforementioned groceries disappeared, Mr Uber was at Ms Baseball Funkette's Party Barn door straightaway. Then before you could say \"Bob's yer LGBT Uncle who used to be yer Aunt\", we are deposited at the Logan Square Farmers Market or LSFM.\n\nMusic, vegtables, bread, fruit, pastry, soap, flowers, bikes, organic and the opposite of organic?!?, dogs, over-priced and priced just right, strollers, cheese, sausages, wagons, salamis, honey, empanadas, crepes, art... maybe a Garfunkel (props to BNL)...\n\nAll in all this Farmers Market was one beer tent shy of Sunday morning PAR-TAY! Clearly one of the best FM's we Funksters have perused in a long time. \n\nAnd to top it off, just at the end of the block... a little \"While You Where Sleeping\" surprise... as Bill and Ted were known to utter, Most Excellent!",

            "description": "This outdoor LSFM is the farmers market to be at!! It's a personal favorite! Located a couple blocks from the Logan Square CTA- Blue Line. Vendors offer a variety of fruit, vegetable, honey, pressed juice, pizza, bread, live music entertainment, pastries, meats, flower bouquets, salsas, cooking oil, tamales, empanadas, and lots more! Vendors are certified with organic foods.\n\nMy favorite vendor is the Windmill Ginger Brew (non alcoholic ginger beer that tastes like concentrated soda juice). If you love ginger, kombucha, and wheat grass shots, you'll LOVE this. The chorizo empanada was also memorable and full of flavor. We brought a ton of vegetables, sourdough loaf, sunflower tendril peas, Chicago Co-op Honey, and had a pizza from the Langhe Market vendor.\n\nCompared to Wicker Park's Farmer Market, there are more vendors and it is more crowded. If you are specifically looking for meat, Wicker Park has less expensive options. LSFM is my favorite, overall. Most vendors have a samples of their products, and are looking to start a conversation with their customers. So much fun!\n\nThe Logan Square Farmers Market is May-October on Sundays from 10:00AM-3:00AM. I would recommend this place for co-op members, people watchers, and farmer market lovers. Be sure to check it out, and you may even put this stop in your Sunday routine!",

            "description": "On a nice day, this market is a great stroll. Lots of people watching, dog watching, and fun things to buy.\nMy favorite is the salsa/mushroom stand. The canned spicy mushrooms are my fave, but we eat them in like one day.\n\nI also like the flowers and cheeses. Of course there's always seasonal veggies and fruits. Sometimes they seem super pricey, but I guess you're paying for quality.\nThe only area I find lacking is the prepared food/things to eat while you walk. There's a taco stand, some type of asian chicken stand, juices, ice cream and donuts. It's a nice variety, but we've tried them all and they're just okay.\nI do love Letizia's baked goods. They have some really good cookies and little pizzas.",

My husband and I met up with a friend to grab some food and walk around the market. It was so cool that you could still order beer and other drinks at the bar while people shopped all around you. There wasn't a lot of produce, but there were still your typical farmers market goods such as honey, fresh bread, soaps, some herbs, and canned sauces and salsas. \n\nThe best part was the selection of snacks to nibble on while you're there. We had delicious steak tacos and my friend had both Filipino and Latin American empanadas. \n\nThis is a great spot to hang out with friends when you're looking for something different to do than stuffing your face at a breakfast diner. I mean, I love doing that too, but I wanted something different and this was great!",

            "description": "There are 2 separate Yelp pages for the indoor and outdoor Logan Square Farmers Market, but I'm writing a little bit about both on this page (the indoor one).\n\nThe indoor Logan Square Farmers Market exceeded my expectations.  The outdoor one is so large, so I didn't know what to expect from the indoor one when I visited recently.  The indoor location is easy to find, and has large signs outside of the building labeling it.  There also appears to be a parking lot next to the building in case you want to drive to the market.  \n\nThere are some awesome vendors inside the Logan Square Farmers market.  Examples of products you can buy include: fish, soy cheese, veggies, gourmet ginger beer/ale, Italian sausage.  There are countless other products to pick from as well.  Most of the vendors are so outgoing and passionate about the products they sell.  I spent a little bit more money than planned during my first indoor market visit, but there were just so many appealing products I wanted to try out.  \n\nIf you are looking for a fabulous outdoor farmers market during the warmer months, you really need to also hit up the outdoor Logan Square Farmers Market as well.  One of my favorite things about the outdoor market is the fact that there are several vendors serving hot food to go.  Both the indoor and outdoor market's are well run and a pleasure to visit when you are looking for Midwestern produced foods/products.",

There was a great assortment of food options - not only to have a snack, but also some very nice looking veggies, flowers, cheeses, etc.  The prices were a bit more expensive than some of the other markets (a chocolate cooke was $3), but the quality was good and the stalls all had very friendly staff.\n\nI'd stop in when in the area, though not sure I'd make a specific trek here as I have closer markets to me.  \n\nSome of the stalls were the same as ones that are at the Green City Market, but in a smaller venue, so less of a wait!",

Live music rings in the air.....\n\nFruits and vegetables(blueberries, cherries, plums, peaches, greens, watermelon, swiss chard, string beans, potatoes, onions, garlic, mushrooms, carrots, beets, lettuce, tomatoes.... ok must I go on? Let's just say summer's bounty.\n\nOn the prepared side:flavored shaved ice, ice cream, iced tea, fruit drinks, chai, confections, hot sauce, bread and other baked goods(including a gluten free bakery), kale burgers, beef burgers, pizza, sandwiches and of course Gayles grilled cheese sandwiches(with a gluten free option).\n\nFor the home there are flowers, plants and soaps, snacks for pets.\n\nThis has become my favorite Chicago farmers market.

Lots of vendors with fruits, vegetables, pastries, breads, and handmade products. There is even a doggie treat stand, chocolates, homemade sodas, donuts, cheese, olive oil and balsamic vinegar, flowers and gluten-free/vegan desserts. I just started going to this market two weeks ago and have been doing my week's shopping here. I can easily find a parking spot in the neighborhood and take my little dog (she seems to be a big hit with everyone) with me. My husband commented last week on how good our dinners dishes have tasted since we started shopping here. They have a water stand, too, which is helpful since it's been awfully hot lately. The organizers of this market are doing an awesome job!",

            "description": "This is my favorite farmer's market in the city. The selection is great the location on a warm rain less day on the boulevard is beautiful. Otherwise this market moves indoors down the street during the cold months and on rainy days. The very nice mix of vendors keeps me coming back time and time again. As others have mentioned, sometimes parking is a bit of a challenge but I usually find a spot after a few minutes of looking. After I have found good place for my car, I seek out my favorite vendors. Well to be perfectly honest, I stop at just about any vendor that catches my attention with their offerings. I don't memorize all of the farmers tables that bring out beautiful produce because many overlap with the same offerings. But I try to stop and purchase from as many of them as I can. Depending upon my upcoming week's food needs. I try not to purchase too much because I don't want to lose anything to spoilage. Plus I realize I am paying a premium price for for that was very recently picked and usually taste better and has more nutrition that the typical grocery store. When you purchase at a grocery store, you don't know how long ago it was picked therefore it probably is not as fresh or nutritious.\n \nI always have to buy microgreens for my salads at American Pride table. If a need a picker upper, than a energy jolt at City Press Juice and Bottle is always nice. It's hard to pass up the beautiful and unique flowers at The Flower Garden. La Boulangerie makes some very good bread, as a matter of fact some of the best in the city. Who can resist Letizia's Natural Bakery tempting sweets?? For those of you that love homemade style sausages and bacon then at stop at Underground Meats is a must. I have never been let down by any of my purchases at any of these vendors.\n\nEach time I pass the Jake's Country Meats table I always remember that once again I forgot to being a thermal bag with ice in it to purchase meats?!? Next time Jake because I do care about eating quality meats that were not massed produced and raised humanely.\n\nAlso, if you didn't eat anything and are hungry after shopping for the upcoming week then there are tons of great restaurants within 2 miles of the market. Good luck in your farm to table search for great produce!",

There are food stands--tacos, crepes, zeppole, sno cones, and probably more that I fail to recall.  Something really for everyone! We really enjoyed the fresh berries and cherries from our last visit. And the sno cone syrup is on my list for next visit.\n\nThis is a great place for all ages--I appreciated the little area where a live band was setting up and they set up a place for kids to draw and pin up their artwork on a clothesline as part of the \"art' section.  Lots of strollers so watch your heels.  Lots of dogs out with their owners. Catch a sunny breezy day and the LSFM is perfection.",

I bought some at the first stand I saw for $4. Then I saw some at another stand for $3. And then!!! $2!!!! What a rough life I lead. Lesson learned...check all stands before committing! I'm horrible with commitment and see what happens when I finally man up and bite the bullet, totally screwed! Just kidddding. :D\n\nMany thanks to the homie Matt R. for reminding me about this Sunday market. I went to the market this past Sunday and I must say this ain't your 'burbs farmer market. There are so many booths - a wide variety of fruits, veggies, baked goods, jams, meats, cheeses + music!!!  - just about everything you could ask for. There are also so many people - hipsters, families, friends, couples, a bit of everything. And! When it's 90 degrees out it can be a bit brutal with the people everywhere. I've never been to such a busy farmer's market in my life. \n\nI absolutely see myself coming back but I'm going to wait for a day that isn't so blistering hot so I can do more than a quick run through.",

Everyone is really friendly, produce and fruit (love the peaches) are fresh...I don't know something about the vibe is off. I was about to say maybe it's a little too family friendly for me and all the kids throw me off. LOL...can't put my finger on it.",

            "description": "To gain entry into the Logan Square Farmers Market, you must possess at least one of the following:\n\nA stroller (bonus points if your toddler is clad in baby Toms)\nA dog (bonus points if it's a mutt and/or rescue and/or has only three legs)\nSeveral visible tattoos\n\"Handcrafted cocktail\" moustache\nAt least one item of vintage clothing\nCirca-'68 Jagger haircut hiding under a knit hat\nStatement sneakers\n\nIn all seriousness, none of these are a prerequisite, but you will for sure see all of the above, and in many cases, by a single individual.\n\nSo the Logan Square Farmers Market has grown and prospered much over the last few years, and since I go just about every week in the season, an update (and addition of a star) is very much warranted. I actually live so close to this Market, that it's practically on my front lawn. I couldn't avoid it even if I wanted to, so I've learned to embrace it (not that I have much of a choice).\n\nThey've added a lot more vendors over the years, like Katherine-Anne Confections, Spencer Jolly Posh Foods, Rare Bird Preserves, and Koval Distillery. Food options aplenty: Zullo's, which sells zeppole (donut holes), Cherub's (great tacos), bangers at Spencer's, crepes at Cook Au Vin, Puffs of Doom (artisanal cream puffs) and several stands that sell baked goods.\n\nObviously there's a ton of produce stands selling fruits, vegetables and herbs (my favorite is the one that sells any and all varieties of mushrooms), as well as flowers. Prices are generally the same from vendor to vendor, but it's worth it to scour the market before purchasing to make sure you're getting the best deal.\n\nThere are also tents for community organizations and local businesses like IGO Car Sharing, and Alive Rescue, an animal rescue group.\n\nCash is king at the Market, but if you stop by the Logan Square Chamber of Commerce tent, you can pay by credit card and get vouchers to use at the various booths. There's almost always live music playing at the Market (sadly it usually involves banjos). Leftover and excess food is donated to a local food pantry.\n\nThere's a lot of good things happening at the Logan Square Farmers Market. I do wish they were open earlier than 10 am, but I guess lazy hipsters like to sleep in on Sunday mornings.",

            "description": "Okay, after five years, I must revise.  This market has probably tripled in size, and serves both types of patrons--those who want to shop for real goods and those who go for something to do (possibly even, dare I say, to see and be seen?).  \n\nThere is definitely a lot to see, taste, and smell.  The market strikes a good balance between prepared foods, specialty foodstuffs, and actual produce.  Size and variety is an asset which most neighborhood markets cannot boast.  One could eat very very well there, then go home and eat very very well for the next several days.  Despite the east-end profusion of wild boar ravioli and organic snow cones and artisinal cream puffs et alia (all very delicious, I'm sure), down on the western half it is an honest to goodness farmers market with more fruits and vegetables than you can shake a sprocket wrench at.  Color me satisfied.  I will still go to Evanston on Saturdays, but if I need produce on a Sunday, Logan Square would be #1 on my list.\n\nIf there is one significant criticism left, it's that the booths are too close together, both side-by-side and across the aisle, leading to general crowding and an inability to \"take it all in.\"  I just didn't feel that I could look around or ahead and get a good sense of what was available.  I couldn't really see a booth until I was right on top of it.\n\nOh, and also, the opening hours are laughable--10am to 3pm.  Bunch of lazy hipsters!  By 10 in the morning I should be at home with my wares, cooking second breakfast.",

            "description": "The LSFM and the Green City Market are my two go-to markets in the Chicago area.  Both are excellent, but I tend to like the vibe of Logan more.  The vibe is definitely very laid back with lots of families and their fantastic canines spending what I believe is the perfect way to spend a Sunday afternoon.  \n\nMy go-to stand places for produce such as corn, melons, and carrots is Geneva Lakes.  Their goods are consistently of good quality and prices are super reasonable.  If salad mix, kale and other greens are what you're looking for, hit up Growing Home (located right across from Geneva Lakes).  They tend to also have fantastic tomatoes in the summer as well.  More awesome than their produce is their model.  They're a non-profit organization with urban farms in the South Side of the city, and they really do a great job in training less privileged people in the community by providing training on the job and in the future.  For meat, Mint Creek, Cedar Valley and Jake's are present at the market.  Both Mint and Cedar have fantastic eggs and Jake's ham and bacon are top notch.  \n\nYou cannot leave the market without having brunch.  The two vendors I tend to gravitate towards are Gayle's for grilled cheeses (breakfast ones are decadent) and Spencer's for a banger+back bacon sandwich.  Floriole out of Lincoln Park has a stand to help curb your sweet cravings.  Aside from the sweets (love the doughnuts), they have these personal sized pizzas ready to be devoured.  I have yet to try one, but they do look good.  If you're looking for a loaf of sourdough or a baguette, La Boulangerie is your stand.  I love the sourdough bread!  The consistency makes for a great sandwich or some French toast!  \n\nDespite being located in a busy area, parking is actually not too difficult to find.  You can always find spots on Milwaukee within a few blocks.  The area is also easily accessible by the Blue Line and various CTA bus lines.",

This is as good as the Evanston farmer's market, but with a very specific different focus.\n\nEvanston is basically all varieties of plants and flowers, logan square is basically all varieties of vegetables and restaurants from the area. \n\nNotably, chicago diner had these bahn mi wraps (which are *awesome*) 2 for $5, as well as some awesome taco stand which had equally amazing Horchata. Did I mention the tomatoes the size of a grapefruit? Yeah, this has to be seen to be believed.\n\nLocation is a little difficult for parking (plus to Evanston), but variety is good. It's also notably smaller, but there's plenty of open grass areas to sit and relax (minus to evanston, you only have tables near the entrance).  \n\nI'll be coming back here every weekend, and I love that the crowd is logan square crowd (different age group) vs Evanston market crowd.  Not everywhere accepts credit cards, but many do. All I can say is, go forth and check it out! This includes many of the vendors seen in Evanston, and seen at the Glenwood market (the folks with the mushrooms and the tomato sauce folks).",

I was also pleasantly surprised by the balance between prepared foods and fresh produce-- thought there was going to be more in the way of vegan cupcake food trucks or some such yuppie nonsense, but it was really pretty balanced and the selection was great.\n\nMy major gripe is the $5.50 for a dozen eggs, which every stand seems to subscribe to.

New Wave is smart to have a table set up to get an iced coffee fix while wheeling around my little dude.\n\nI like that the market is set up on one part of the street and into the boulevard. Oftentimes, we go to the part of the boulevard where families set out blankets and eat their farmer's market goodies.

They did have apples, and very delicious blueberries that were grown in Michigan and frozen, and tasted oh so fresh, as well as some indoor-grown greens.  This time of the year the market focused more on goods like baked goods, candies, sauces, and more.  The baked goods included the ever illusive vegan macaroons and creme puffs.  Yes, I admit I tried both of them and they were delicious!  I also fell in love with the kale burgers, lovingly made and frozen for your convenience.  \n\nThe market also offers a variety of local restaurants serving up their specialties, as well as musical entertainment that varies each week.

            "description": "I love a Farmer's Market I can walk to -- just gets ya in the mood!  Just grab my reusable tote bags, my sunscreen, and my cash and I'm off to a fun Sunday at the market!! The Logan Square Farmers Market actually accepts credit cards, but you have to get a ticket then take it to another cashier tent and then come back to the original vendor's tent.  This is great for those using link cards, but otherwise slightly inconvenient.  If you have cash, better to use that for transactions to save you wait times in the cashier line and your vendor lines.  \n\nEven on days when I don't need groceries, I still enjoy heading to the Logan Square Farmer's Market as it's a great place to lunch.  I love their mexican food vendor.  They offer tacos made to order!  The line is usually pretty long so be prepared to wait a little.  There are also other restaurant vendors that sell brats, chicken tenders, and other foods.  \n\nThe variety of fruits and veggies here are great.  The farmers that come to this market to sell their goods are super friendly as well.  Whenever, I didn't know the difference between certain veggies or how to cook them, they answered my questions in a very friendly way!  Thus I always left feeling empowered and excited about my fresh finds at the market.  There are also vendors that sell honey, jams, and flowers -- the usual variety you would find at a farmers' market. I truly enjoy coming here when I get a chance.  The prices are pretty on par with other farmers' markets and it's great talking with the vendors. \n\nMy only gripe is that sometimes, after a Farmer's Market, the boulevard is left a mess.  Probably more the customers of the market causing the issue than the vendors, but sad when food/garbage is left on the grass or picnic table.  I usually walk my dogs down this area either the evening right after or the morning after, and it just plain sucks when people don't take the effort to throw their garbage into the many trash cans around and they just leave it. \n\nAll in all, the Logan Square Farmer's Market  has all of the staples you'd expect from a farmer's market -- fresh fruit/veggies, jams, flowers, and ready to eat foods.  Best of all it's right in the middle of the homely Logan Square neighborhood so you get that feeling of escape from the city.  It is truly a gem!",

If I smell like mocha and look like an almond when you see me, please don't be surprised or try to run away from me. I promise that I won't turn you into a mocha almond too.\n\nAs much as I love the almonds, I wish that they and the other food stalls here are cheaper. According to my friend, who is a chef, the tomatoes and mushroom here are fresh yet too overpriced. \n\nRegardless, I will come back to check out the jam next time. \n\nFood: 3\nService: 3\nDecor: 3",

Ready to eat food/dishes, as well as tons of fruits, veggies, cheeses, and meats to take home and cook up a good dish. There is also always live music entertainment that you can listen to during your meandering walk through the market. The musicians vary from week to week, so there is a good variety. It is great for all ages and even dog friendly! You can also pick up a beautiful bouquet of fresh flowers. I have never been to the indoor market during the colder months, but plan to try that this winter. If you haven't made it to this farmers market, I recommend going soon as it will go indoors at the end of October!",

Many of the usual vendors from the summer market come to this one as well. There is a great mix of raw ingredients, prepared foods, and local craft goods. There are still enough options to give you some meals for the week but not nearly as much as over the summer. There it's everything from salad mix, to free range meats, to fresh cheese, to kale burgers. Check it out if you haven't yet! It's worth the trip!!",

Anyway I agree completely with Amanda below. Best Sunday activity and I've done the yoga! Really great. The best part about the Logan Square Farmer's Market (and I do love the one in Wicker Park) is its not too hustle and bustle like so many others.

Grabbing some fresh produce from local farms, vegan baked goods from local shops or even a full lunch to eat in the grass. \n\nI suggest going earlier in the morning, as it tends to get pretty crowded as the day progresses. Still great for people watching, and dogs are welcome! Which is great, but my dog doesn't do well with crowds. It does get a little frustrating when everyone is all over the place. But I can't blame them for being distracted by all the goodies and not paying attention to where they or their stroller are veering. \n\nI'm happy that the winter market has moved out of the congress lobby, as I feel it's in a better location now. But I'm so excited for the summer market to open up in May, so I can feel the sun on my shoulders as I fill my bag with the most delicious market offerings.",

It always has a small-townish feeling to it and you sort of feel like you're at a state fair, but with much much better food and produce to select from. \n\nIt's amazing how crowded the Logan Square Farmers Market has gotten over the years. Now you have to wait in a good sized line just to get some horchata from Cherubs' stand! Seriously, I'm not kidding. It's fairly crazy as it's not like Cherubs is all that far from the Farmers Market and it's not like Cherubs is barely ever open. To the victor goes the spoils I guess. \n\nBut, that really isn't the point. What is the point is the absolutely fantastic produce, meats, and breads you'll come across here. While I wouldn't say that this is the cheapest Farmers Market out there, that also isn't the point. You come to a quality Farmers Market to get really good wares, which is exactly what you get from here. \n\nSimply put, I always look towards the few Sundays I have off during the summer and the Logan Square Farmers Market is exactly the reason. I just can't get this kind of quality in stores. I'm also able to get a great amount of quantity to go with the awesome quality as well. If you fancy yourself as someone who even remotely enjoys cooking, this is one of the best Farmers Markets to come to. Trust me, you won't be disappointed.",

Want to pick up some produce, but the grocery store never has fresh produce? Want to take your dog for a walk with new scenery? Want to do yoga? Want to grab a bite to eat? Want to pick up some new flowers to replace those dingy ones in that vase on the counter? You can do all this and more any given Sunday at the Logan Square farmers market. It isn't too big, but they pack a lot of great stuff into the space they reserve. They have everything from produce, flowers, meats, eggs, pastries, to ready-to-eat meals. It's great even just to walk around and look at everything, it can be a very eventful Sunday morning mere blocks away from your doorsteps.\n\nAlso, they sometimes offer free yoga lessons too (I don't  know all the details, but it looks fun). I believe the farmers market goes until October, it's a great Sunday ritual for me!",

This place is not Aldi or Walmart, there is no mass production to grow the profit margin. That's kinda supposed to be the point: paying more money to have better quality AND getting the benefit of meeting some of the people who grow the food.\n\nIt's beautiful. There are a few flower vendors. Random non-food vendors. Random musical performances. Prepared food vendors! This year I've eaten bangers and donuts and chimi-churri sauce covered meat. Loaded with kids and dogs. \n\nThe cheesemonger and mushroom people who are at every Chicago-area FM are here. \n\nI don't stock my pantry here, but I always find something fun and delicious.",

I grew up in the small town, and as a child was surrounded by vegetables from the garden, and as much fruit as MN weather could support. \n\nI have never, ever, been to a farmer's market with prices like this one has. I could drive for an hour or two, find a produce stand on the side of the road, and still save money, gas included, compared to what I'd spend here. A quart of fruit (about 1.5#, people) for $5 or $6? What? At that point, you're gouging me, I don't care how local you are, or how nice you are. I could stop at almost any gas station in WI and get cheese just as fresh and organic and the cheese people tried to sell me for a third the price. Don't even get me started on $15/# sirloin. \n\nI understand we're not in rural America; we're in the third largest city in the country. OK, I get that. The problem is I can get produce and meat anywhere from 25-50% cheaper from many different places in the city. It's just as organic, natural, and most importantly, it tastes just as good. \n\nI am willing to pay more to support a local farmer (local in this case being within a 50 mile range, which isn't very local if you think about it), and I am willing to pay more for \"better\" quality. I am NOT willing to subsidize someone's career choice to this degree. I can drive through rural IL, WI, or MI, and find just as much fresh organic produce along the side of the road, for half the price, if not less. \n\nLogan Square, I love you. Take that farmer's market and shove it in Lakeview or Lincoln Park, where its prices belong.",

After brunch at Longman & Eagle, a friend of mine and I wandered through. This does not compare at all to the one in my neighborhood, and in fact it puts it to shame. And it's not just the variety of goods and produce and specialty foods, but the sheer size of the market, its perfect location in the wooded boulevard, and the interesting crowd it draws. Lots of people were sprawled out on the lawn and parkway, picnicking, playing games. I think George Seurat would have a great time painting a few scenes here. It all just feels very European. I managed to pick up some scrumptious truffles and made some mental notes about what I would buy when I come back here on my own. What a delightful surprise this market is, and it well exceeded my expectations. Shazaaaaammm!",

I am so much happier with the market and all that is has to offer this year than I am with last year's performance.  Yes, it's still small.  Don't get your hopes up and think that it's expanded or anything - it's still on the same part of the boulevard near the Square.  However, things have just gotten a lot more bustling and happy!\n\nWe took a trip there today and the place was packed!  Seeing so many people there was really, really great.  I'm glad there's a lot of Logan Squarers who come out on Sundays to mingle with others from the neighborhood.  There were kids, dogs, musicians, artists - representatives of the community!  Each week there's a musician (or group) filling the market with some nice sounds.  \n\nThere's a few more vendors than last year and each booth seems to have more to offer than last year.  There's tons more produce (especially fruit!) and a lot of specialty products that I don't need but want anyway.  Five Cheese Garlic Spread from the River Valley Ranch?  Delicious!  Various cheeses from Provenance?  Super!  Blueberries from Noffke's Farm?  Bravo!  Cr\u00e8pes from Coq au vin?  Chouette!  \n\nI'm much happier this year than last and going to the market has become a staple of my weekly comings-and-goings, rather than a once-a-month thing.  Get yourself out there to participate in the awesome neighborhood happenings - there's much fun and food to be had!",

            "description": "Mere steps from my apartment each week, I get to witness a growing example of a Chicago \"animal\" - the baby farmer's market.  You can tell these younger versions of the full grown farmer's market by a few telltale signs:\n\n1) There are pregnant women.  The first stage of farmer's market development is to lure these with nutritious (mostly) organic food so fresh that not even one of Chicago's healthy food purveyors can compare.  When fully grown, the adult farmer's market will have strollers being pushed around by breeders with no manners and their screaming children.  Thus the baby farmer's market is better. \n\nLogan Square Farmer's Market is, unfortunately primed to grow up pretty quickly as it's on pavement and not grass making it easier to push a stroller.  Ick!\n\n2) The market is smaller than a full grown market.  Don't be fooled, however.  Like many small, adorable youth in nature, the baby farmer's market might rip your face off with its hidden power.  From organic soap (with $1 samples) to fresh bread bakeries to Michigan fruit, it has everything you need.  The adult farmer's market may have more stalls, but most of these are based mainly on redundancy.  Five cheesemongers are nice, but if they're good, one will suffice.  And,\n\n3) While it does not fear strangers, the baby farmer's market will stick close to its nest.  Instead of recruiting from all over the city, LSFM sticks to the west side for restaurants (with almost no lines) and non-farm vendors (including a couple local food co-ops).  The produce is from all over, but it's got a good local flavor.  And a secret I've never participated in, you can purchase farmer's market baskets for the season and pick up weekly produce if you're in the neighborhood.  Also, the market likes to call back the same vendors week after week and year after year.  It breeds a feeling of familiarity that many adult farmer's markets don't have.\n\nLogan Square Farmer's Market already draws customers in from all over the Milwaukee Avenue corridor so it won't be long before it's much bigger.  It has room to expand further down Logan and it's already gotten larger each year.  I'm just going to appreciate it now before it grows up and gets bothersome like many of the mature farmer's markets in Chicago.",

After going to the 61st street farmer's market in Hyde Park for the past few months, where they have less than a dozen total vendors, this farmers market was overwhelming! \n\nWe ended up having to sit down and plan out our meals for the week instead of just picking up what looks great. \n\nI did end up with about a dozen peppers of various varieties - even a dark purple one! We like to try something new, so we picked up some mustard greens - no idea how to cook them yet, though! \n\nThere were also TONS of dogs!\n\nCan't wait to go back next week!",

He warned me in advance that it's nothing like Green City Market over by my house, which ended up being a good thing (at least to me).\n\nFor starters, the stroller patrol seemed to be missing from this farmer's market, but from the number of pregnant women I encountered they'll probably be in full force next season. Also, there was less redundancy instead of 5 different cheese and meat vendors there was only one or two of each. Lastly, the lines and crowd were much more manageable; the wait for a crepe at Green City averages 30-45 minutes, in Logan Square it's more like 5 minutes tops. \n\nAll of the vendors at this market were friendly and very enthusiastic about what they were selling. I sampled some creamy jack cheese which made me weak in the knees. The Abbey Brown guy suggested a $1 remnant bar of soap since he could tell I was struggling with the decision to part with my cash. The bar is a perfect, dreamy smelling reasonably sized trial size, I also got a little card so I know where else to find them through market season when I become hooked. I picked up some amazing bread products from Golden Rise Bakery, mmm are their baguettes delish! To cap it off my visit I enjoyed a wonderfully yummy butter and sugar crepe from Cook Au Vin on a park bench while listening to accordion music, it made me feel like I was kicking back in Paris. Le sigh...\n\nBottom line: It's small, but a well chosen group of vendors which maximizes selection and minimizes redundancy.",

With this in mind, you can't happen to pass by the various unique live entertainers including a washboard-tap dance team, a honky (not meant to be insulting) tonk folk music group that sings songs in other languages and Lil Ethan's Back Rubs, a boy who offers should massages for 25 cents with his dad accompanying him at his side.\n\nIf you're hunting out a Sunday market, don't miss out between June & October, 10 am - 3 pm.",

This is a small farmer's market, but I feel that there's a bigger sense of community when you are visiting these smaller and more focused events.

Jakes is wonderful, I love seeing Nate and Lou Ann every week - knowing who raises your meat is the best thing.  Their Italian Sausages and bacon are wonderful.  Piedt Farms is also great, has the best corn I've eaten and we love their Honeycrisp apples also.  Spencers Sausages are at treat also, and this year the Chi-Scream cart has been something we look forward to each week!  I'd say that the LSFM is a very close second to Green City and is much more convenient to get to so certainly check it out.\n\nThe biggest hang up I have with the market is some of the vendors won't let us try their product before buying which is something that is a given at Green City, and a big reason we choose to shop at FM vs. grocery stores.",

            "description": "OMG! The prices here are way more than they are at Jewels!! Durrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr, I don't get it. Does it have something to do with the fact that Jewels can buy in bulk from massive farming operations that can contain their costs easier, all the while engaging in unsustainable farming practices and spraying the food with Agent Orange? Stupid microeconomics. You slay me with your six syllables and complicated logic.\n\nI mean, seriously, I could totally drive an hour or two, find a produce stand on the side of a country road and still spend less on produce than I would at this market, even after accounting for the cost of gasoline. (Never mind the fact that I'd be wasting two to four hours of my life driving to the middle of Bumfuck, Nowhere.)  And once I randomly found a produce stand after driving around aimlessly for a couple of hours, I'd definitely be able to find every kind of seasonal produce, bread, meat, and cheese in that stand because as everybody knows, those rinky dinky stands hold an unlimited supply of food and always offer the largest variety possible. And sometimes they give you super awesome splinters! For free! But really, I wouldn't drive that far for produce. Instead, I'd just drive a little further west of Logan Square and buy a watermelon from some guy in a smelly truck parked on Fullerton who looks like Chewbacca. What's not to like about Chewbacca? \n\nLook, let's not kid ourselves. These local farmers are totally full of bullsh*t, and I ain't talking about the pasture-raised kind. I mean, who do they think they are avoiding Monsanto products and sacrificing crop output somewhat, just for the sake of sustainable farming and not destroying Earth's resources?! Really??? That's just dumb. Also, any fool knows that driving a refrigerated truck for 50+ miles is insanely inexpensive, not to mention really fun. How dare they bump prices up to cover the cost of such things! I'd rather just drive two hours to buy my groceries and receive some free splinters. Wouldn't you?\n\n....\n\nLogan Square is a great community, as evidenced by how much this market has grown over the past few years. Frankly, this market is phenomenal. The variety is good with plenty of vendors, and the atmosphere is friendly. I'd rate this market a close second to Green City. \n\nIt's cool if you don't want to shop here, and I can sincerely say that you'll get no judgment from me on that. But if you go here and then whine about the high cost of local, sustainable, organic produce and pasture-raised meat, then frankly, you're incredulously ignorant. Sure, some of the food is overpriced, but when you study the economics of what you're buying, most of it isn't. You're a silly willy nilly billy if you think buying organic, \"natural\" food at the grocery store--yes, even Whole Foods--is comparable to buying from a local, sustainable farmer. \n\n\nThese are my favorite farmers at the Logan Square Farmer's Market, which is in no way suggestive that other vendors aren't also great: Otter Creek Farms, Jake's Country Meats, M's Organic Farm, Nordic Creamery, River Valley Ranch, Roedger Bros Blueberries, Sweet Earth, and Tempel Farms.",

It's like I just walked into bartertown. Two enter one leaves? I'm too used to this place being filled with punks and metal-heads, not local farmers educating me on organic dog food and how blueberries are kept fresh in the winter. \n\nI can't stay negative, because a winter farmers market in Chicago is like a bed and breakfast in hell. Of course you're not going to get the myriad fruits and vegetables, but you will have a good selection of sustainable and grass-fed meat, cheese and artisan breads.

Trash litters the site, bins are overflowing with stinky organic garbage days after the market is over and the grass is totally bald.

All the produce looks fresh, and I get the feeling some are coming from smaller farms, which may account for its variety. There's less of everything, but no shortage as far as I could tell, even coming later in the day. \n\nMost of the vendors I interacted with were very friendly. I prefer this market over Green City as it's also a lot less crowded, and Sunday fits my schedule better, but it's nice to have options on different days.\n\nThe only downside is that it is just as pricey here as at Green City market or Whole Foods, which is as pricey as it gets. Aren't we in the heartland of farming country--midwest? I am willing to pay more for quality and freshness, but it just seems exorbitant to charge $3 for a bit of italian parsley, and not a huge selection of herbs here, either. I can't seem to find anyone who sells cilantro. I thought this town was big on Mexican food.",

We wandered for like 30 minutes, admiring the produce and all the yummy looking prepared foods that you could buy. \n\nWe were very upset, since we were stuffed AND had no notions of what we wanted. Since everything looked good, it was very hard to even begin thinking of meal planning. \n\nDefinitely will need to come back again before the season is over and buy up more then flowers and heirloom tomatoes.

It's small enough to not be overwhelmed by chefs and people buying in mass quantities, but larger and more diverse than the French Market in Lakeview, for example. \n\nI always manage to find something tasty- usually a fruit which ends up being delicious dessert. This past weekend I snagged some green beans that were so fresh they snapped like crazy! Also got some cheese curds that were still squeaky!! EEEEEEE!! Anyone originally from WI knows that's the only and the best way to eat cheese curds :)\n\nLastly, I love that this farmer's market really hits it's stride around 12 noon.

I can be into that.\n\nI know there are occasionally some issues with prices, but honestly, if you don't want to pay good money for good food then the farmer's market is not for you.

Some examples:\n\n-  I wanted to buy 8 bulbs of fennel for dinner grilling.  They were marked at $2 each.  I asked if I could have a deal since I was buying so many, and they gave me 8 bulbs for 10 bucks.  SCORE!\n\n-  A woman asked if I wanted some of her beautiful tomatoes.  I said, They look delicious, but they're a little out of my budget.  She gave me a paper lunch sack FULL for $5.  \n\nOh, and shop around the various stands before you decide where to buy, that will help with your bottom line too.",

            "description": "There's really nothing better to do in Logan Square on a nice summer morning, than to take a stroll through the farmers market.  If you are okay paying a little more for fresh product, you'll leave the market inspired to cook a great meal.  For people that live in the neighborhood over the years, you know the leaps this little market has taken to expand each year.  I like to hit up the cheese guy, since he'll slice your cheese in front of you depending on how much you are looking to spend.  I also like taking home a few large portobello, drizzling them with olive oil, balsamic vinegar, salt & pepper..and throwing them on the grill.  If you go to the market hungry...then some tacos from Cherubs is the way to go.  Is the market comparable to the large ones in California...no....will it do the job, sure it will.  So go hit up the cash station, and come prepared to be inspired to make something delicious.",

            "description": "For the city, this is a great farmer's market.  It isn't too crowded although there are a number of strollers and a lot of people during peak times... things tend to get picked over by later in the time as well (it's 10-3pm ususally so go earlier).  This doesn't compare to a more rural countryside farmer's market but brings some good produce, meat, and other items to the area.  Note, don't expect everything to be 100% organic here - so ask how much something is sprayed, how it is treated, etc.  Another tip, bring your own bags so you can carry what you buy home.  You can drop quite a bit of $$$ here versus buying organic at Marianos/Whole Foods but we have had some pretty delicious fruit/veggies from here still.  Finally, as of 2013 more and more vendors take Square and electronic payments; however, cash still is the easiest to deal with here.",

Everyone walking around the cold hall in their winter coats, a quiet guitar being played somewhere in the cavernous lobby\n\nThe crepe guy and the pork guy are there and most of the goods are canned or baked but it's winter so its not like they'd have fresh vegetables.

I always thought that markets are for shopping, but at this market only window-shopping is possible. Common really......!!!! Pound of tomatoes is 4.00 bucks and  and pound of meat is ranges from10.00 to 40 bucks. And anyway there were like 15 stands and half of them were flowers and herbs. I would love to support farmers with all my heart ( parents used to own farm---worked all my childhood) , i know how hard to be one of them, But sorry guys....won't buy a bunch of lettuce for 8 bucks. \nThe major folks there are 'New waive hipsters'  who look poor and educated but surely don't have any student loans and real bills to pay (there is no way you can afford to buy anything at this market after ur monthly bills).\ntwo stars--- because it was nice day to go for a walk.\nyea.... and check the one star review of Adam S. really good summery.",

Try the tacos and apple cider donuts -- to die for! Great selection of seasonal fruits and veggies, grass-fed beef, farm-raised meats and organic bakery items and treats.

Perhaps it was the time of year, or the fact that it was July 3rd and a lot of the farmers would rather be partying in their fields and setting off organic fireworks made of beets and ginger beer?  Maybe I was hoping for more of a renaissance fair atmosphere.  It just felt like a so many booths were imitations of each other.  I have the mentality that says, oh if you walk down to this dejected looking booth they will have some phenomenal treasure for less then the cost of any other booth.  No, the produce and the pricing was rather uniform and I didn't feel very compelled to explore because of this redundancy.  Also, it can get to be exhausting having your feet crushed by stroller wheels.",

It's walking distance from my house so that probably helps.\n\nThe neighborhood has done a great job in selecting vendors that provide seasonal items that are of great quality. Plus, there are lots of options for breakfast/lunch ready food that is made on the spot from places like Vella Cafe and Treat. \n\nIt has a European vibe to it too. Sometimes it feels like hobits will be coming out from around the corner. Maybe that's just when the flute player is on stage...\n\nAnyway - I stock up on all my produce for the week and I'm never disappointed in the selection.

I didn't see too much in the way of cheese vendors (except for Provenance, who had a booth there like other local vendors Fonda del Mar and Vella Cafe).  But they had a decent organic selection of meat (ham, bacon, chicken, etc) from a few vendors and a great selection of vegetables.  Most were decently priced, somewhere in between a neighborhood grocery and Whole Foods - which is what you should expect for organic food with no middleman or fancy marketing on the part of a store.\n\nI wish I could do all my shopping at farmers market's, but I still have to get some other staples elsewhere (sliced ham - Wally's, Mexican produce and other products - Windy City or Cermak or Carniceria Jimenez).

I was 2 minutes late for Golden Rise Bakery's last loaf of Russian black bread, alas.

I got there at 10:30, and I'd say 10% of the stuff was already sold out. Unlike supermarkets, these guys don't have semis full of Chilean produce coming and going. \n\nAnd here's the best tip I can give: have breakfast at Johnny's Grill (see my review) beforehand. The lining of grease in your stomach will help keep you from buying more than you're gonna eat at the market. Oh, and they ARE accepting credit cards for the first time this year.",

While it is not a comprehensive market a la Green City, it is perfect for neighbors and anyone else looking to spend some time supporting local businesses and getting a little fresh air.\n\nI've gone over in the morning (this market doesn't begin until 10 am), and have found a few things each visit, which is about what I expected.\n\nMy last discovery was a dozen farm fresh eggs for only $4.  Organic eggs were $4.50 -- on sale -- yesterday at Jewel!\n\nWicker Park does have the Nichols farm booth (with lots of produce options), but it really doesn't have that many more booths & none of the prepared food offerings (since it is a city-sponsored market, as opposed to Logan Square, which is independent).  I use this as a comparison since they are both on Sundays, and located in similar neighborhoods.\n\nHeck, check out the new market at Sears Tower if you want something even smaller.  New markets need customers to thrive, and the more that come to Logan Square, the better it can become in the future.",

A few stands had squash, which were good, too.  There were booths selling honey, and entrees or something from Lula (*shudder*), as well as the truck with pulled pork sandwiches.\n\nOverall, it has some stuff to supplement your vegetable shopping, but by no means replace it.  This last time was cool, I chatted with the farmer selling corn, got a corn fritter recipe off him.  My big disappointment was that I woke up late and by the time I got there (1:30pm), the berries had sold out. :(",

From 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. on Sundays, stop by the lobby of the Congress Theater and check out the winter market. They expect to run through March, with a few Sundays off for holidays. I assume then they'll go back to their outdoor location on the boulevard.\n\nThe winter market plans on still providing locally produced agriculture products, so expect root vegetables and fruits that have been \"put up\" by canning or drying. Although, right now there are still a ton of apples at the market. And cider! I got a bag of honey crisp apples and some cider for Dallas. I'm told that throughout the winter you can also still get greens and mushrooms that they grow indoors or under glass or plastic. And there will still be farm fresh meat and eggs. Of course, all the baked goods and prepared food items will still be available. Along with the apples and cider, I got some lettuce and 2 bags of homemade granola.\n\nAs well, the winter market may also showcase Logan Square Chamber member businesses. All in all, it doesn't seem like they're going to have issues running the market through the winter, which is exciting.\n\nI'd never been to the Congress Theater before and thought it was funny that my first trip there was not for a concert, but for the farmers market!",

For some reason, I had always envisioned this to be a bigger market -- it just seemed in line with the Logan Square lifestyle (the veggie-heads and organicos, I mean). But it was about 15 stands along a little sliver of a cul-de-sac between Milwaukee and Logan... cosy, but I was disappointed for the downsized shopping experience.\n\nNevertheless, the market tried hard and that almost made up for it. All the vendors and farmers were happy to explain their products on sale, there was free sampling, and you could feel the goodness of the earth in the air. I left with a pint of blueberries from Michigan, a block of chipotle cheddar from Sugar River, Wisconsin, and a blueberry-peach tart from Logan Square standard Lula Cafe. (During the week, these transformed into toppings on yogurt, grilled cheese sandwich and a nice dessert with vanilla gelato a la mode.) I can't complain about a great way to spend a Sunday morning before softball -- now I'm just waiting for the market to be supersized.",

Packed with people every week, and folks actually hung out there chatting with community spirit this year. :) It feels like a \"real\" farmer's market. \n\nIt's such a Logan Square neighborhood thing. It's like: everyone's there! You feel like you fit in, and it's fun to admire everyone's earthy style. \n\nAs for the food, Hurrah! I have gotten so many great ideas, tips, suggestions, and encouragement from the various vendors this past season. I've made sorrel vinaigrette, squash bake, roasted baby onions, sweet turnip salad, and honey crisp oatmeal bake all for the very first time this year. I made the most delicious butternut squash soup this very evening for the first time. Let's just call this market the \"cherry popper.\" (Woodstock organic farm & City Farms are my fave.)\n\nThis is not to mention the dead sea bath salts, chamomile face soap, and fresh flowers!  This market is great on many levels.\n\nIt's growing, to be sure. But it's an important (and wonderful) community hot spot now. I only wish the Chicago growing season was more like California and less like Siberia........ can't wait til next year!!!!\n\nI love you, Logan Square Farmer's Market!

There was even entertainment in the form of a fella with a washboard accompanying a tap dancer.\n\nIt's not a big market, as others have mentioned, but it's a nice little market with some nice offerings and I'm glad it seems to be thriving.\n\nAnother interesting thing this year seems to be the impromptu yard sales on the boulevard! There were a TON of people out there and had I wanted to scrounge around through other people's castoffs after purchasing my produce, I'm sure I could've walked away with a few items!",

I got there at 1 p.m.; the market runs 10 a.m.-3 p.m.\n\nMaybe it's too early in the harvest.\n\nMaybe I just don't know how to shop this style of farmers market.\n\nWhatever it was, this place just didn't work for me. There were just as many carnival-style, fast food vendors as actual farmers, and the selection was quite limited.\n\nOther than a few tomato plants, I don't think I saw a single fruit. Some booths were selling subscriptions to CSA's, but I don't play that.\n\nI wanted to walk over, grab some produce and meat, maybe some dairy, and walk out. Cash for food from the people who made it, simple.\n\nI guess it's back to shopping Jewel.",

Yeah, the Logan Square Farmer's Market isn't huge, and it doesn't have the variety of Green City.  But for a local, neighborhood farmer's market, I think it does a good job.\n\nIf I didn't live in the neighborhood, I probably wouldn't go.  I can't lie.  That said, though, all the people at the booths I went to were friendly, and I managed to pick up some nice carrots and scallions, as well as a few different baked goods and some specialty soap.  It's really nice to have it in the area, and I'll be coming back.",

I've often missed farmers markets because on weekends I like to relax for a while before getting started.  Like until noon.  When I read that at 11 I realized I still had a chance and yanked my ass out of bed.\n\nI'm glad I did.  Yes, it's small, though I was told it was bigger today than even last week.  I got beets - the guys working the stand told me some easy ways to cook them.  They also had a cute plant called a rabbit tail, I think it was.  But I kill plants, so I left that for someone else.  The next stall over I just asked for advice, I ended up with chard for the stir fry my boyfriend is planning for this week.  And one more over, some beautiful cherries.\n\nThere was also some soap that I glanced at (I love handmade soap, but I'm very happy with what I'm using), and a place where you could sign up for 3 months of produce or meat from a sustainable farm in Ottawa, which we will probably sign up for.  My favorite purchase?  The Greek flatbread.  That was my lunch.  Damn was it tasty!  I wish I had another piece.  There were also a stands for flowers, bakery, and yummy sounding sandwiches that I will most likely check out next week.\n\nGo and check it out.  Buy some produce.  Support these people and our market so that it will stay and get bigger!",

They are THE place to go if you want delicious, natural meats.  I started getting the chicken and pork chops a few years ago, and was blown away.  The burgers are also fantastic, as are their steaks.  My fiance and I loved it so much (natural AND delicious!) that we joined their meat share/CSA this winter, which has been awesome.  It's also surprisingly affordable.\n\nI would recommend that any omnivores looking for some quality local meats stop by Jodi and Beth's booth at the Market and give their products a try.

            "description": "I think many people miss the point of smaller neighborhood farmers markets. The smaller markets offer independent, smaller businesses an opportunity to \"get their feet wet\" in the farmers market, and allow you to walk a block rather than take a bus/bike ride across town to shop. If you look it up or search for them, you'll find there are nearly a HUNDRED seasonal markets throughout the city. Most of them, like Logan Square, are independently run; they are not funded by the City. They cannot all be like Green City. And who would want a production that big in a tiny corner of Logan Sqaure every Sunday anyway?! \n\nI find the smaller market to be refreshing compared to Green City or Daley Plaza's market (which are also great in their own ways). And the prices tend to be a smidge cheaper. The vendors at Logan are more attentive and appreciative of your patronage, probably because they're not as busy. I'm on a tight budget, but I make it a point to support this market and other independet ones in neighborhood \"pockets\". Any time you can buy from a farmers market, you're helping support local growers, (often) organic farming, highly motivated business people and  talented artisans, and you get high quality products. \n\nOne thing people need to keep in mind when shopping at markets (and buying organic in general) is: It costs farmers more to produce smaller crop yields when they don't use chemicals. And don't forget the cost of gas it takes them to get that one bushel of fresh asparagus all the way from Michigan to your doorstep. Small farmers vending at these markets are not using non-regulated chemicals in foreign fields and using inhumane labor to bring you cheaper, redder apples from Chile. They take pride in their work, and we should show our appreciation by purchasing from them when we  can.\n\nIf you want to pay 49 cents for green beans, go pick you own at a local farm in Indiana or Wisconsin. Once you figure in the price of gas and the time it took you to pick them, you might as well have paid the Logan Square market price. Or just go to Dominicks and get the non-organic ones grown in a greenhouse in Argentina, and pretend they're from your own backyard.\n\nHowever, I do think the Logan market could use one or two more produce vendors. I think the neighborhood could support it.",

My family and I come here after church every Sunday to buy food, picnic, and socialize with the neighbors. Also it has really expanded this summer, and together with the picnickers is beginning to take over several blocks of the Boulevard. For me, it's less about the food (although it's delicious, and there is enough variety and competition that you can search for some good deals) and more about the social interaction in a beautiful, green urban setting. I hope it grows and grows, and I hope the police ease up on the spontaneous yard sales that sprout up adjacent to it. Also would be great if the Alderman finally got the cajones to close down the Boulevard to cars every Sunday as well. Wishful thinking I suppose.",

Well, they lied.  Though the market is pretty big, one third of it is dedicated to coffee and breakfast./lunch vendors, and as for \"having everything\"  I did see some good variety including homemade soaps, honey, a solid amount of greens and a plethora of overpriced meats, I did NOT see anyone with dairy products.  None.  We went to the market with a list of greens and cream and were only able to attain 50% of it.  We stopped to ask the very helpful fella at Mint Creek what the dairy situation was and I guess there's one vendor that brings milk every other week.  This week was not our week.  It's milk, people.  Not askin for much here.   Anyway, I'll stick to the market on 61st.  Less tattoos and more produce.  Plus they have milk.....all weeks.",

This is not a grocery store where things get shipped from all over. The farmers are very friendly and will tell you about what they do and where they are coming from. I picked up a half gallon of apple cider from a farmer that drove a couple hours from Michigan. I think is really cool that people drive a little out of the way to share their tasty food and we should take advantage of it!\n\nThe prices are very reasonable, probably would spend the same amount at dominicks.

We love to buy the bangers and smoked sausages, on top of being very cheap, they are the best sausages we have ever had. Once you attend a few times, you know exactly what tents to pick up your items from and we have that down to a science now! Most if not all accept credit cards, they will hand you a ticket so you can pay all at once from the associations booth in the front of the market.

Alas, there was no one throwing fish, nor were there booths upon booths of..  well, anything.  There were probably only about 10-15 vendors total.  I was pretty disappointed by the lack of fresh produce..  I had visions of walking out with shopping bags full of carrots, broccoli, apples..  sigh.  There was a distinct lack of a variety of fresh fruits and veggies.  However, what was there was good stuff.  I left with a bunch of peonies, a loaf of garlic bread, mixed greens, croissants, herbs, strawberries and a whole chicken.  Everything thus far has been lovely.  I like that it starts at 10..  I tend to sleep in, so not having to drag myself out of bed to get there at 7 when some of the markets start is a major plus.  Something tells me the only way this place will grow is with some TLC from the locals, so get off your butt and head over there.\n\nUpdate 7/8/07:  Just visited again, and my, how this little gem has blossomed.  I think this place has almost doubled the number of booths in the past few weeks.   I came away with not only flowers, bread and another (presumably) delicious chicken, but plenty of fresh produce (cherries, peaches, broccoli, new potatoes, snap peas, lettuce--yum!  And there was plenty that I wanted to try and couldn't carry).  And Provenance, an awesome wine and food store, is going to be coming there starting next week.  Hooray for my neighborhood!",

It's not a grocery store...you can't go to the farmer's market saying I must have apples or tomatoes in June.  It's SEASONAL, flexibility is key.  Additionally all the produce I've bought at the market has last 3X longer than the near-refuse sold at Jewel, Dominics or Stanleys.  It's a crowded market and the vendors are knowledgable and in a good mood.  I'd pass on the bread stand - tarts, cookies - bleh, the baguette is not good (like crusty Wonder Bread).  But!  Mmmm iced coffee at the Vella stand.",

I was able to find some great flowers and I can always get a really nice cup of sweet tea. Maybe it's because I'm used to the downtown weekday farmer's markets with tons and tons of tables packed with merchandise.  I have high hopes that it will keep improving and it's worth visiting but don't go planning to fill up on veggies & fruits for a week.  It's just not there yet.",

Heirloom tomatoes and other nice fruits and veggies.  Also, I get the co-op honey and it's the best honey I've ever had.  Right now the flower selection is amazing and cheap.

Therefore there was not a lot of selection, and I was hoping for more produce to choose from. We were able to buy a large bunch of fresh basil for cheap, and hopefully when it rolls around next Spring it will be a more lively place. It is nice to have a farmers market close to home where we didn't have to worry about parking.",

Yes, you will not find peaches or apples in the early summer. Because that's not how nature works in this part of the world. But if you come open to trying new foods and willing to be flexible on your purchases, you can find some great eats while supporting local businesses. \n\nThe prices...well, without knowing how agricultural businesses work, I won't claim to know if they're overblown...but they ain't cheap. So bring some cash and come ready to try something new.",

            "description": "Logan Square Farmers Market is my favorite farmer's market in the city.  It's a nice sized market with sufficient variety - it's not too big or too small.  Prices are decent compared to other markets, like Green City Market.  It attracts a decent crowd, but isn't too busy. Parking is easy to find and we often bring their dog with us.  It starts late (10 AM) compared to many farmer's markets on the weekend.  I think this is a plus because you don't have to get there crazy early if you think you may be looking for something that might get sold out.  And who wants to get up early on a Sunday?",

The vendors are super friendly, and I've purchased some of the best blackberries and heirloom tomatoes here.  Golden Rise bread - yummy!!  The apple-flavored and coffee-flavored caramels are tasty little treats too.  I heart Logan Square Farmer's Market!!",
