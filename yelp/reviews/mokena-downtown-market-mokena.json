            "description": "Please, Mokena, If you're going to host a Farmer's Market, you must do something to attract vendors. This review, in no way reflects my opinion of the vendors, just the lack thereof. I'm certain that they weren't any more impressed with the turnout than the shoppers were, with the selection. There's a reason why most of them packed up early as we browsed.",

            "description": "The Mokena market is located in the street by the Metra. When it was the French Market, it was in the Metra parking lot. Now they just block the street.\n\nWe were in the neighborhood and decided to check out the \"new\" Mokena market. \n\nNot sure what this market is trying to be, a farmers market or a flea market. There were just a couple produce stalls, a few home renovation stalls, some crafts and a lot of vendor stuff - think Avon and Pampered Chef. And a guy that had boxes of candy for sale, like it was Halloween time at the Swap O Rama.\n\nI'll stick with the Frankfort Market.",
