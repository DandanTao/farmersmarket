            "description": "Best Orchard to pick from!  If you are looking for a ton of things to do outside apple picking, this is not the place for you--and that is what I love about this place.  Free to get in and you are not bombarded with extras like other orchards so this place is def easier on the wallet than most other orchards.  \n\nThey put out a list of which apples will be available for picking so def check that out if you are looking for a particular type of apple. \n\nYou can purchase a basket or bring yours from home at no charge other than the flat fee for the basket which is approximately $36.  You take a wagon to the area for picking and pick your apples and then hop back on to the next area.  You can always grab another wagon if you want to go back to the main area.  \n\nThere are some ponies to ride and a free playground for the kids.  There is food so you can have lunch and the best is the baked potato tent!  The store have everything, but most importantly, their apple cider donuts!  Their raspberry salsa is to die for!  It's cash/check only so be aware of that, but they do have an ATM on site.\n\nThis is def a must-go if you are looking for a good family orchard without all the extras!",

I bought some corn salsa that is to die for and a candle that rocks my world lol! \n\nBad things, the petting zoo is a couple of goats. Very underwhelming. When we were apple picking the honey crisp area was picked over. It was kinda gross, a lot of damaged apples do it was hard to find good ones. \n\nOverall I loved it because I had a great time with my family.",

I really hope the orchard starts shipping them nationally. I've had cider doughnuts from other places, but none were as good as theirs. \n\n\"Sadly we cannot ship donuts, cider, or apples, we don't like that once as they are out of our hands we don't know in what shape they'll arrive.\" - Edward's Apple Orchard FAQ page\n\nTo the business: Plenty of businesses successfully ship doughnuts with them arriving in good condition, and I bet you would make a pretty penny off of shipping yours. Would you reconsider your no-shipping policy?\n\nEnd the Californian good doughnut drought.",

            "description": "Had the best time at this apple orchard! we came on one of the last weekends left for the seasons for Apple picking and left very happy as this was my first time apple picking. I remember the bucket cost us like $40 so it's a little pricey but the apples were absolutely delicious and I would like to make this an annual thing with my kids. I will just try to come a few weekends before as the apples weren't as plentiful by the time we were there and there were a lot of bugs around which may or may not be a good thing. I hope they don't spray as many pesticides but I understand why they do as we wouldn't be able to eat perfect looking apples otherwise. We picked a bunch of Red and Granny Smith and even a few pink ladies, we really found a good selection of all. \n\nAlso the apple cider donuts are no joke and seriously some of the best I ever had as well as the apple pie, wow, you really need to get that. Their little shop of all things apples is also adorable and I wish it wasn't as crowded so we would have spent more time there but seriously this is one of my go to favorite fall activities from now on! We will come back with the whole family next year since we had a blast!",

We grab a bag of donuts fresh out of the fryer and walk around eating those sweet, crunchy fluffs from heaven. We love browsing all of the other food goodies and home goods. This year they even have super soft shirts and hoodies. They provide an awesome, cleanly array of samples. They are well staffed and incredibly friendly and organized. We didn't have to wait in a single line this morning. After making our purchases, we tried to walk off at least one donut petting the animals and going through the maze. Can't wait to get home and dig in to some dips and salsas!",

The line might look long and deceiving but it actually went pretty fast and the staff was super friendly. They even brought a basket to me when they saw that I was carrying so many things. They even have samples in their store on the second floor of the main Barn. This place is kind of far and kind of in the middle of nowhere. I've been to the different types of it or apple orchards this is a little bit smaller than a typical ones that I would see closer to the city of Chicago but it was still a must-see. My only complaint is that a lot of parts of it was muddy. I got my shoes dirty but I guess that's kind of expected when you go to places like this. There are donkey rides but there's only a 70 pound limit so I was kind of bummed out about that. There was a maze but is full of mud. I wish the petting zoo was a little bit larger there was only turkeys chickens and goats. I wish there was more animals next time maybe a little bit more than just goats.",

            "description": "We went on Sunday Oct 8, 2017, 80 degree weather by 10am! Very beautiful. My baby and hubby first time so wanted to give them the full experience. Planned trip so already knew what to expect and how much $ we were spending. It was more for the experience. \n\nArrived around 9:15am, still ample parking. We parked across the street since we planned on going to the pumpkin patch and berry picking last. \n\nTook our pictures by the sign and got our donuts first ($10.09 for a dozen donuts). No lines, nice and smooth. Went to the playground for a bit then made our way to the orchard. Was going to ride ponies but my baby was too small for it, will have to wait till next year ($5 by the way)\n\nTractor ride was fun. Got a whole truck to ourselves. There was 6 of us and a baby hehe. The price was $43 for a basket ($3 deposit if u want to return the basket, we kept ours). I believe it's required for every 6 ppl. Got about 70 apples in it hehe. \n\nAfter picking apples, we went and grabbed a snack. Six apple pies with ice cream ($26 and some change). The girl took my order wrong and only wrote down 6 ice cream  so I had to re-order and paid the difference. How annoying but was not so busy so it was ok. Lines started forming after we got our snacks. It was around 11am. \n\nAfter that we went to the pumpkin patch and berry picking field. Pumpkins were $4 and $8 (only two prices) depending on the size. Berry carton was $3.50 each. \n\nWe were done by noon. It was great. The line to get into the parking lot was literally a mile long when we left. So glad we went early (we are early birds anyways hehe )",

            "description": "We love going to Edwards Apple Orchard in Poplar Grove. Their barn is filled with all kinds of goodies, treasures, food mixes, samples of jellies, salsas, salad dressings, snacks, fresh apples, cheeses, you could spend hours in there! There's books, children's toys/clothing, pet supplies, fresh fudge, home decor! So much to see! They have a photo opportunities, children's play area, pet viewing area, goat feeding area, corn maze. Another barn with old time farm tractors and implements, apple & berry picking. Sometimes live music! Also a little cafe where you can get barbecue, hotdogs, apple pie, Mac n cheese, apple cider, etc. Literally something for all ages. Pony rides, wagon rides! Picnic area seating. Favorite part are the warm apple cider donuts, freshly made there! They are warm and crispy on the outside...I never wait to eat them. I wander around the barn eating them right out of the bag because they just aren't the same later! They are still tasty, but you don't get the crispness from the freshly fried cinnamon sugar coated donut! Get a dozen! You'll be glad you did, next day, zap them for 10 seconds. Perfect fall activity for all generations!",

The barn, the music  everything else is a family favorite but the baskets for apple picking have gotten smaller and price is $48.00 a basket. Seems like if you have over a certain number in your group you are told you have to do minimum of two baskets! We were in line to pay for our baskets and i overheard the gentleman next in line say to the register guy\"What, 48 dollars for a basket?\" The guy taking the money replied.\"Tell you what, i will make you a special deal.\" Hey we werent offered a deal! Guess we should have also voiced shock. Next time will do that. That really bothered me.",

There's also pre-picked apples and a small array of cheeses. \nThere's the small caf\u00e9 that offers fresh apple pie.  There's the bigger caf\u00e9 where you can get a meal. The area is huge, well-laid out and totally country cute. Like I said--the Disneyland of apple picking. \n\nI did like the doughnuts (although my favorite apple cider doughnuts is still Harvest Time). The slice of pie was warm and perfect a la mode. I did buy some pre-picked apples and some snacks too.  Although I think the prices are a little higher than what we pay for apple picking--but you gotta pay for the upkeep.  Every person working here that I spoke to was super nice and helpful.\n\nThere was a nice crowd, but it's early in the season...I can see how this place can get packed easily.  So if you are one that needs all the distractions when you go apple picking, this place is for you. This scene is definitely not for me, but I do appreciate what they have available and see that it can be a fun trip.  \n\nCash is king! but they do have ATM's located in the stores in case you don't have enough green.",

They have many different types of apples for purchase or pick your own, the Autumn Beauty is one of our favorites. The cider donuts are to die for, warm with just the right amount of cinnamon and sugar, a taste of fall in every bite. Eat lunch in the Apple Barn,  the pulled pork is delicious and finished off with homemade apple pie and ice cream is a treat.  Shopping in their store is a feast for the senses from jams to fudge to all kinds of sauces and all can be sampled too. They even have beautiful home goods too. Also a great play area for the kids and tractor rides....too much to post it all. A great family tradition, be sure to have your picture taken under the arbor with the year above.",

            "description": "I believe that reviews should provide some sort of useful information to the reader, so I hope that after you finish reading this review, you'll think *wow, great tips man!*.\n\nThe first time I went to Edwards Apple Orchard was when I was about 8 years old. They were some great times, and for some perspective, that was about 15 years ago. And not too much has changed. This past weekend, October of 2016, was the last time I went and here is my advice.\n\n#1. If you show up after noon, you will wait in a MILE LONG line to park. Ho-lyyy Crap. Luckily, we got there early this year at around 10:30 am and everything was fine. We parked quickly, got on the tractor quickly, everything was great. When we left at around 1:30, the line of cars trying to get in was over 1 mile long. I kid you not. Do not show up after noon, you will be waiting hours just to get in.\n\n#2. It is 40$ to apple pick here, and then another 3$ for the apple basket (if you bring your own, you avoid the 3$ charge, but if your basket is smaller than the ones they give you for 3$, you still pay 40$ to apple pick and get less apples, you understand?). If you come here with your girlfriend or husband or best friend, it's still 40$. It's 40$ to apple pick regardless of how many people you have. If you have over 6 people, it's 80$. This isnt some small farm where you pay for what take. You pay 40$.\n\n#3. This place has the best apple cider donuts. Of course, all apple cider donuts at apple picking places taste great. But the ones here just taste better. They just do.\n\n#4. The lunch here is expensive. So maybe eat before you come here. They also dont like when people bring food from outside, so you gotta figure it out. Keep in mind what I said before about arriving late though...\n\n#5. They have pick your own pumpkins here as well. Flat cost of 8$ per pumpkin. Most places don't do this anymore so have fun!\n\nEither way, enjoy! It's a great place. Kind of pricey, so come with your family. And dont come late.",

So, I thought \"oh no, the lines\" all of that is a bit energy drained. Well guess what?!?! All the lines move very fast! No matter how long they are, they move fast.  We did the apple picking. For that, you go all the way to the end and wait for a ride. It's past the pony ride. We got a bit lost lol. 40 dollars and 3 dollars for the basket rental or you get to take it. We took it! It's cute. Even though it seems so expensive, when we got home we counted 76apples and we got to choose frome three different bushels. Some where huge and other apples small. The whole experience was just unforgettable. \nAfter apple picking, we went for food. The food was so delicious! It tasted so fresh. Specially the donuts. They have three locations for food plus the store where you can get dozens of donuts to go plus all sorts other goodies.\nBasically we fell in love with this place. Even though its about an hour and half to get there from Oak Park, it's so worth it.",

            "description": "Initially was very resistant to driving over an hour, to the middle of nowhere. I was pleasantly surprised with how nice, clean, and organized the orchard was. Get there early, gets very busy. Lots to do for kids, and a very nice store with good quality products, not \"crap fair\" aka craft fair quality. Great apples, good donuts, and overall a great time! Will return for sure.\n\nThe negatives, while limited I want to point out. I have twin 5mo babies, and we brought a stroller to push them around the Apple orchard rows, but were told when we got there that there were no strollers allowed. Bring a carrier so you can wear your baby, or babies. Wish I knew ahead of time. Also, they drive you to the rows which you can pick from, which there were 2 available when we went. Got plenty of apples, but kind of wished we could have wandered around more like other orchards allow.",

Ambient is great. Love the smell. Very homy, and of course it gives a very Autumn feeling. Great place for kids to come and play, great place for family fun. \nThey don't just offer apple pies and what not. They also offer hot dogs, BBQ pulled pork sandwiches, and around September/October, a local church comes and does baked potatoes; which I believe it's delicious. Over all. It's been my favorite place to go to since I was a kid, and it has became a family tradition to go during the Autumn season. Highly reccomend if you are a tourist, or just haven't been here, COME. you'll love the place. with items they used back in the olden days, and the little shop (well not so little anymore) that's is located on top of the eatery.",

            "description": "I was hesitant to review hoping my family was the only group that received shameful treatment by the staff, but after losing sleep over it and reading many reviews, it is clear that is not the case. \n\nThat staff was unnecessarily rude to my family and was completely unwilling to accommodate our mid-sized group. While the rules are clearly posted and understood, the staff continued to treat us like nothing more than a commodity. My extended family drove from many hours away to enjoy a nice day together, but the staff had absolutely no care or consideration.  One employee even went as far as to stalk our group because he was empowered to do so and made childish comments when we collectively decided to get our money back and forgo apple picking.  I have never been treated so inhumanely in my life. \n\nI proceeded to speak with the owner who too was passive aggressive. His perceived racism and support of his staffs behavior was quite frankly shocking. He made it very clear that the discontent and treatment of my family were of little concern to him because they service \"15,000 other visitors each day anyway.\" \n\nAlthough the grounds provide for a lot of fun activities, especially for the little kids who loved the day, there are too many other options for picking apples and pumpkins to visit a place that cares more about profit than customer experience.  I personally had come from the city planning on purchasing many fresh goods, but after our experience, could not support the farm. \n\nNeedless to say, we will probably never go back and would not encourage others to either.",

            "description": "Do you like Apples!? How do you like these apples!? I got a number....OF APPLES!!!! \n\nI have actually never been apple picking a day in my life. I have always wanted to go. We finally made a plan to go w/some friends but didn't know where exactly we were heading. All I knew was we had it on the calendar for today & when that reminder popped up earlier this week, I immediately got on Yelp & started my research . There are many options of places to go within an hour or 2 of home. My mom and I chatted about where I should look & suddenly, I found a place in Poplar Grove. 40+ reviews and 4-1/2 stars...sold!!!\n\nWe hopped in the car & off we went. An adventure in Illinois; a trip through small towns; a stroll through an orchard...this is what our day would bring. I recently found out some not-so-great news & what this has done for me has been very positive in many ways because I'm really soaking up my life & the people in it. What kind of memories did you make today? Mine were priceless. \n\nEdwards is a lot larger than I expected. They certainly have a great set up here: beautiful country surroundings, a picturesque apple orchard and plenty of stuff to do for the whole family. I learned today that 30 is not too old to ride in a wagon pulled by horses. Hell, you're never too old!\n\nThe people that work here are awesome! The energy and vibe of this whole place was excellent. Everyone was so friendly and helpful. I don't think I saw one person without a smile on their face the entire day. The wagon ride was fun because you got to see the whole orchard. It wasn't very long but very fun nonetheless. I even pet the horses after our ride. \n\nApple picking is at the East end of the FREE parking lot. You pay at the small shed, grab your bushel & hitch a ride on the tractor. They had both Golden & Red Delicious apples today. First we were dropped to pick the goldens. Take as long as you need to pick because there are constantly tractors coming around to pick you up. The orchard was packed w/apples. I had never seen so many apples on a tree before. It was amazing. We got some gorgeous photos & really made some memories while snacking on apples right there in the orchard. The goldens where def my favorite of the day. They practically melted in your mouth. They were so fresh, there is not even a word for it. The red delicious were also fantastic and I'm telling you, I can't wait to bake something apple-y! \n\nThe store here was never-endingly fantastic. They had everything from specialty candy to jams to fall d\u00e9cor and this is where we found the fudge.  You can pick up some holiday gifts here and they are my kind of gifts...edible!!! They have samples throughout the store and let me tell you that this stuff sells itself. For example, we sampled a strawberry pepper jam that was mixed w/cream cheese...oh yeah; I immediately picked up a jar! My hubs found some summer sausage and I found the fresh cheese curds. You can also sample some apples in case you didn't make it to the orchard; they had different varieties in here. \n\nThere is a food area w/things like hot dogs, but we wanted to find a restaurant elsewhere, so we skipped the food here. We found a small maze made up of wire fencing & let me tell you, it was difficult! First time I was in a maze, too! Next to the maze, we stumbled upon some adorable Billy goats!\n\nYou can pick your own pumpkins or you can simply purchase already picked pumpkins. We stopped somewhere else on the way out to Edwards so I didn't look at pricing but everything was very reasonable here, so I feel confident saying the pumpkins probably are reasonably priced, too. Today was also the last day for raspberry picking & due to some rain at the end of our trip here, we skipped the raspberries. We'll have to check them out next year.  There is lots of parking, again, it's FREE so in case you are trying to cram your whole group in a car too small, don't hesitate to bring the extra vehicle. You'll also need the space to load up your amazing apples. \n\nBreakdown of pricing I found important:\n-BRING CASH or Check. No credit cards accepted here!!!\n-Entrance/Parking: FREE\n-Wagon ride: $4 pp\n-Apple picking: $40 per bushel + $3 deposit for bushel. 1 bushel min. for groups up to 6 (I believe); 7+ people: 2 bushel min. Tip: bring your own bags & return the bushel if you want to get your $3 back. We kept ours, it was too cute not to, plus we came unprepared to transfer the apples from the bushel to bags. \n-HOT Apple cider: $1.50\n-FRESH Cider donuts $.75 Tip: the donuts in the caf\u00e9 below the shop were fresher than the donuts sold upstairs. However, they do not sell the donuts in the caf\u00e9 to-go. Note to self: bring a Tupperware for next time and load up downstairs.\n-Fudge: $6.99 per half pound.\n\nWe decided today that we're making this an annual event. Edwards was a great find and I cannot wait to return next season. \n\nLife is short...pick the apples.",

The original barn and parts of the property were destroyed by a tornado several years ago. Despite this act of God, the family rebuilt and continued the family business that all have grown to love generation after generation. You'll see remnants of the storm's aftermath hung in the interior of the new barn extension.  Mother Nature doesn't mess my friends. \n\nNo one can come close to an apple cider donut like this place. All kids activities are\nfree, unlike the Apple Holler. Grab some apple pie and ice cream in the cafe underneath the barn, tour the farm equipment museum, or take a ride in the horse and wagon ride. The kids have plenty to do with a small petting zoo, straw jumping barn, and corn maze. \n\nIf you're a lover of orchards be sure to add this one to your list of \"musts.\"",

Everything from the abundance of parking, to the new and improved ordering line, to the big red jug seats, to the maze...just...everything. Edwards is perfect.\n\nI've long since moved away from the Rockford/Poplar Grove area, but every trip home I get my first impulse is to go to the Apple Orchard. They've got an amazing play area for kids, accompanied by a decent little petting zoo with the cutest baby goats I've ever seen (I haven't seen many). The walking maze is as fun as ever no matter how old you are, and they always seem to be adding another model building or tractor to the play area. I'm serious, this place is a dream land to kids. \n\nThe donuts and cider haven't changed as the decades roll on, and I hope they never do. I only recently started exploring their other options (like pie), and unsurprisingly I was not let down. \n\nThe shop has expanded exponentially and is a great place to kill a little time out of the sun. Lots of little trinkets and sauces, candies and drinks to buy. \n\nEverything about this place is good memories waiting to be made. I can't wait to go back.",

Granted it was a lovely day, the place was extremely packed to where it was uncomfortable. Lines to get their delicious apple cider donuts, apple pie, and baked potatoes too over an hour each! There was way too many people and not enough places to sit.\n\nIt took us 30 minutes to park, and exit lanes were blocked. Someone definitely needs to manage the parking better.\n\nMy recommendation would be to add more order and efficiency to everything here. This is why Ive started to dread coming here because I know I will be greeted with chaos and long long wait times.\n\nIf I am in the mood for their donuts, I drive to their west side location and avoid all of the fuss.",

The apple cider donuts are so yummy, as is the fudge and all of the delicious foods they sell. We love that they have lots of samples so we can taste test things before buying. We've bought many things we never would have otherwise because we got to try before we buy. The food, the gift shop, the whole atmosphere... perfection. The only downside is how expensive some items are. It's an apple orchard, and we rarely buy apples because of the price. The highest price of any orchard I've been to. Still, it's my favorite orchard and it doesn't stop us from enjoying everything else they have to offer.",

When we're not able to come my in-laws purchase their frozen [best ever] apple donuts and bring it to us!  You can heat them up in the oven and it tastes so good and brings home memories back. \n\nThis place was rebuilt after the horrible tornado that came through here.  It is a family Event that you can enjoy for a few hours even when it's crowded it's always nice.  The staff is always friendly and there is plenty of parking and it never feels shoulder to shoulder (like in the city).\n\nThey have a really cool gift shop.  They sell home made fudge, fresh apples or you can pick apples from the orchard, there are barns, arts and crafts, pony rides for the kids, small country style outdoors play area for with tractors, slides, trains; there's a eatery downstairs with hot (or cold) apple cider, apple pie, hot apple donuts",

The grounds consist of an apple orchard (duh), shopping, animals, restaurants, and a pumpkin patch. The shopping includes everything from honey, to apple cider, to gloves, to candles, to decorative signs, to stuffed animals, and everything in between. Just make sure to watch prices because it does get extremely pricey. \nThis place has been a part of my life for two decades and on my last trip, I got to bring my husband.

There is soo much to do like apple and raspberry picking, pony rides, big playground with pirate ships to play on and tractor tires to climb on, a petting zoo, and a great grill for lunch. The store inside is great and we never leave without spending at least $100. \n\nApple picking can get expensive here because you have to pick an entire basket full. You can go with up to 6 people so the average per person is only a little higher than a grocery store, plus you get a fun tractor ride to the trees. \n\nMake sure you get a couple freshly baked donuts and cider when you arrive and grab a dozen when you leave. On really busy days they limit the amount of donuts you can buy. During the weekdays, this place is pretty empty but that's because not all of the extra activites are open.",

It worked out perfectly, a quick drive to Poplar Grove and we were off picking apples.\n\nDo you know how good it felt to step outside and breathe really fresh air and not see cement/buildings/filth?  The trip was worth it just for that.  As a resident of the city of Chicago, I felt like I had been transported to another part of the world.  Edwards Apple Orchard is my new \"Calgon take me away\" moment.  (Please tell me you remember those commercials.)  \n\nMy friends and I picked a huge basket of apples ($36).  Pricey?  Maybe.  But I've never picked apples off of a tree before.  They were also very good.  Crisp and flavorful, as all get-out.  This is what apples *should* taste like!\n\nThe pumpkin patch was a little picked over, but we went during the 2nd wknd of Oct, so if you're looking for the perfect pumpkin, go earlier in the month. \n\nAnd now, for the crowning glory--the apple spiced doughnuts.  Served warm and rolled in cinnamon sugar.  My mouth is watering!!!!   I washed it down with hot cider.  And then went back in line for apple pie with cheese.  A la mode.   Don't knock it till you try it.   The line went fast and the counter gals were swift and total dolls. \n\nDon't overlook the doodads and thingy dingys in the gift shop.  Overpriced---yeah.  But why not splurge a little bit?  They even pack up doughnuts for you to take home!  You drove all the way out here, or in our case sat on the Metra for 90+ minutes.  I believe they were cash only, so bring the dollah bills.",

Mary Jo was the last parent and Chris had been talking about a place I have never been. We took the back roads from Elkhorn WI and arrived in the middle of no where to me. Well be prepared when you come on a weekend as you will experience a humanity of cultures and colors. Crowded with kids, grandparents and young marrieds, only enhanced my experience. Great apples and donuts with shelves of memories that Chris just had to take home VIA my Franklin plus a few more Yankee bucks. There was a local group playing on a hay wagon stage that overlooked a picnic area. Petting zoo in one of the many buildings with great staff at every turn to help in any way. Hot dogs and pork sandwiches will help balance the fudge and Carmel corn with the apples to keep the kids going. Bring your best smile as they have an alter back drop with the year, to capture to moment. Very clean and well organized; go during the week if you don't like crowds, but for me that is the best part.",

We ilke to go apple picking and typically spend $30 on one barrel of apples, one down side is you don't get to pick the kind of apple, they do, you typically get a choice of two-three kinds for picking. Regardless, we enjoy every moment and there are ample amounts for everyone to go around. \n\nDid I mention the doughnuts??? OMG, the best and the apple cider is just a must with the doughnut. FYI it is very hard to get a seat in the dinning area, you are waiting most of the time. They have a large children outdoor play/park area with great props. The store on the inside is nice to browse but extensively overpriced items lurking everywhere. They typically have a band, blue grass like music playing for the festivities that gives the atmosphere a nice touch. They also have small pony rides that are for primarily children 50lbs and under, I seen a poor heavy set child denied a ride. Parking is free and the best time to go is during the week when everyone else is gone. \n\nWe always enjoy our experience here, it has a welcoming atmosphere and has been around for many years due to the great experiences. This is a family must fall tradition.",

The Apple doughnuts, hot/cold cider, pulled pork sandwiches (my personal favorite) are all very good and there's no experience like Edwards but I don't think I'll be going back because the prices have become too high for me and my family of four. Three cups of cider is $6.00, a dozen doughnuts $10, 1 gallon of cider $10 and Apple butter (another favorite) $5. I take the trip once a year and try to buy a little extra to last a while. Couldn't do that this year and doubt I'll be able to go back next near. One of my favorite places may have priced me out. Notice I didn't include any Apples.",

The berries are about $4 per pint, which is ok. The store has a lot of great products at decent prices but the winners are definitely the donuts and the caramel corn nuggets. We went on Sunday and it was super packed so if you can go during the week, the experience will probably be a lot better. \n\nI gave it two stars because of the price and because it was very over-crowded but it was our first visit and our last.",

I always liked the cellar but it was a little cramped for me. The new design and open feel made me want to plan a little wedding ceremony for someone down there, that gorgeous.\n\nFor the first time, I took a look at the cool stuff they had in the barn museum/granary, and was pretty fascinated. Definitely worth a gander.\n\nMy only tip: Go on a rainy day. Drizzling, but not a down pour. I go to see farm animals, eat a doughnut (or three), buy some apples and more doughnuts and I'm ready to go, and all of these are still possible on a rainy day since they are all in barns. As long as you don't miss the crowds of people, live music and wagon rides, this is the type of day to go on. They even have people walking you to your car from the store with an umbrella so you don't get wet- adorable.",

And like everything touristy, of course there's a giant gift shop...\n\nThanks to the crazy extreme weather this year, you couldn't go out and pick apples if you wanted to--your options were bags of apples ranging from $9-$11 for what was probably a dozen apples. Going by the tags on the crates, not even sure all of those apples actually came from the orchard.\n\nBut the food was solid. I don't think you can beat getting a freshly fried apple cider doughnut for a buck. Hot, crispy (both from being fried and from the crunchy nuggets of sugar it was rolled in), and a surprisingly light and tender center considering this is essentially a cake doughnut. If I lived closer, I'd probably go out there just to gorge on a few of those every year. But wouldn't buy any to take home--I'm sure you can't replicate the awesomeness with pre-made leftovers. The pulled pork sandwich was also surprisingly good. Generously portioned, easy on the cloyingly sweet sauce, and the pork itself had a great smoky flavor. Good stuff.",

DELICIOUS Apple Cider Donuts, apple cider, apple pie..a cool store to browse.. but with this place.. YOU GET APPLES... a whole bushel full!  Some other places charge you $18 for a 1/2 peck of apples (about 10.. if you are lucky). This place.. I believe its around $30.. but you get a basket to fill and you get to keep it and bring it next time.  When you bring it back you get a discount. Great place to go if you are really in for it for the apples. No website.. so just call and the answering machine tells you everything you need to know. Make sure its a crisp fall day.. you'll enjoy the hot apple cider that much more!",

We rode the wagon ride, my daughter got on the slowest, shortest pony ride ever (that she loved), and we purchased the delicious pantry items that are too good for us to resist: caramel apple fudge, apple cider, caramel apple donuts with and without nuts, mulled cider teabags, and a cool sparkly leaf decoration for my front door!  \nThey have everything for a wonderful family day there, and the smells are amazing. Even though it was extremely crowded, the staff is good at getting people through the lines quickly and I was suprised that we had practically no wait for donuts or to check out, despite the long lines.\nThis year we couldn't pick apples, they said they only had about 50% of their usual crop and we got there the day after a frost, so we couldn't pick berries either.",

            "description": "The older I get, the less I like my home state of Illinois. It's an expensive place to live, it's grossly mismanaged, and traffic is a nightmare in the summer.\n\nOn the other hand... Illinois DOES have Edwards Apple Orchard. This is a wonderful family orchard with a warm and outgoing staff, excellent food, and delicious apples. Edwards is the kind of place that reminds you how good it is to be alive. \n\nI've been going to Edwards annually since I was very little and it's a ritual I look forward to every year. \n\nThese days, I take a day off of work during the week (because weekends at the orchard are far too busy for my taste), grab a couple of friends early in the morning, and get to the orchard while the apples on the trees are still cold. We'll have a few crisp apples while we pick our 1-2 bushels, drive back to the barn, and have brunch in the cider cellar. The food in the cellar is exactly what you'd expect: hot, cheap, and perfect. I usually get a pulled pork sandwich (amazing), hot apple cider, apple pie, and a few apple cider doughnuts (best apple cider doughnuts IN THE WORLD- you can smell them when you pull into the parking lot...). It is a diet killer, but who cares? You have the rest of the day to wear it off. Unless you buy doughnuts to take home with you. \n\nEdwards also has other stuff that kids love- pony rides, a farm animal petting zoo, a maze, playground, and even a farm museum. The barn also has a country shop that is essentially the shop at Cracker Barrel on steroids. I should also note that they have outstanding homemade fudge in this store. \n\nOver the years, Edwards has gotten a bit more \"touristy,\" and fall weekends (as noted) are insanely busy. With all the apples, food from the barn and cellar, pumpkins, and other crap you might buy simply because you only go there once a year, the cost of your visit can really add up quickly. Just be aware.\n\nWith that said, the experience is entirely worth it. If you live in Illinois and have spent the year stressing over machine politics, taxes, construction and the like, you owe it to yourself to visit this orchard -one of the state gems- take a bite of your doughnut, a sip of your cider, and remember that it's not so bad after all.",

Seriously, the fresh, hot donuts were incredible.\n\nCons:\n\nThe apples advertised on the website were not available for picking, we only had access to three types of apples that were within a cordon of caution tape.  We were trucked there in groups and watched over constantly by a group of staff we started calling the Apple Minders.  The trees were nearly picked clean and we were reprimanded for picking an apple a few inches over the caution tape.\n\nYou are forced to rent a half-bushel basket and are charged $40 for however many apples you can ingeniously fit into the rented basket.  You can't use your own bag and still pay $40 even if you half-filled the basket.  Small bags of very overpriced apples are available in the orchard store.\n\nThe shop was massive, overpriced, and cash only.  Most of the goods were not local, including the produce and preserves.\n\nIn general it was extremely crowded and busy, full of rules (NO SINGLE DONUTS TO GO! How do they enforce that? Will they watch me eat it?), and sort of faux-homestyle in a way that creeped us out.\n\nOverall:\nGood apples, good food, good items from the store. But I wouldn't go again and wouldn't suggest it.  There are easier, friendlier, cheaper, and and more fun apple-picking experiences in the area.",

We bought pumpkin butter, apple butter, and strawberry jam. I also took one of the discounted Halloween decoration.\n\nOnly a star less because credit cards are not accepted and we didn't do any apple picking since it was closed but we did get to sample the various apples and went home with a bag of our favorite.",

Go look through the antique farm equiptment and when you're all done with that, eat your weight in warm apple sauce doughnuts. You will not regret it.

This was something we had to do every fall along with getting doughnuts/ I now take my 2 children every year.

I prefer to go on a early weekday  because then its not super crowded as it is on the weekends. My children love the pony and wagon rides! They also love playing in the ship and feeding the goats. The shop is amazing and I love how they have samples of alot of items. My kids love the bags of candy. The apple barn has great samples! I also enjoy how they added the barn outside for food and the inside eatery becomes crowded quick. This will be something I plan to do the rest of my life as long as I live close",

            "description": "Edward's epitomizes what Illinois fall is all about: Going out into the country through the corn fields and changing leaves with your family and friends to enjoy some good midwestern fun.\n\nI moved to Texas a few years ago, and always made a point to get back to Edward's at least once while they were open for the season (Labor Day - Thanksgiving Weekend). I practically live for that first hot apple cider doughnut of the season. They melt in your mouth, coated perfectly with cinnamon sugar. Awesome. They're still good after they cool down, but the hot-from-the-fryer doughnuts are unbeatable.\n\nAfter being hit by a freak tornado in January of 2008, Edward's took the opportunity presented by having their buildings destroyed to greatly expand their facilities. The \"new\" store and Apple Cellar are probably twice the size of the old ones. As a result, they've greatly expanded the amount of stuff they sell. If you're looking for something \"country,\" you'll find it there.\n\nIn addition to apples, cider, and doughnuts, they have a huge variety of fresh fudge, cheeses, and a canned goods - apple butter, pumpkin butter, jams, jellies, sweet corn salsa, local honey, etc, etc, etc. And kitschy fall decorations for your house, if you're into that sort of thing. \n\nI tried the Dark Chocolate Fudge w/ Carmel & Sea Salt this year and it was awesome. Just the right balance of carmel, nuts, dark chocolate, and salt that kept it from tasting too sugary (an issue I have with fudge).\n\nThey have live music, usually bluegrass, on the weekends. There are pony rides, animals to pet, playgrounds, and other things to keep the kids entertained. If you'd rather eat something other than an apple product, they do sell BBQ pork sandwiches and baked potatoes to eat while you're there.\n\nA couple things to keep in mind:\n- Everyone comes here. And I mean EVERYONE. So, be prepared for huge crowds on the weekends.\n- They don't take credit cards, so have your cash or check book ready. They have an ATM if you're in a pinch, though.\n- They don't have a website. Bizarre, but true. So, call them if you want to know something. They usually have a long answering machine message with the info you're looking for.",

This year we went out with the anticipation it was going to be very very busy because this past weekend was so nice (Sept 27 and 28, 2014).  It was packed and we did our yearly traditions first - picture on the bench with new year - walk through the barn to hit up the ATM and donuts and then to get apples.  ATM is nothing new and to be expected.  Donuts are getting smaller but still fantastic.  Apples, we didn't get here.  Aside from now having to pre-pay for apples; while standing in line they removed the Jonagold sign to pick and we were only left with Fugi.  This was at 12:30 in the afternoon on Saturday the 27th; and we immediately decided we were not going to spend $43 for one variety of apples so we left.  ($40 for apples plus $3 deposit for basket; which you don't give back and if you do I couldn't tell you what they'd give you in place of the basket as no one was seen leaving this place without a basket).  I even said to my husband we live close so the drive didn't kill us - but can you imagine the people that drove over an hour to get here to wind up being completely disappointed?  I felt for those customers as I knew they were in the massive crowd.\n\nSince all our kids wanted to still pick apples we went to another orchard that is about a half our East of Edwards (and close to Woodstock) and had a wonderful time.  We still spent $40 to pick apples but we had five (maybe six) different varieties to choose from - and they were bountiful!\n\nEdwards may have been around forever and they have many loyal customers but I believe they are getting over priced and have some great competition around the area.",

Don't knock it til you try it, it's amazing.\n\nEdwards features the cutest free petting zoo, ponies for the little ones, and hay rides if you're looking for some laid back family fun. There is also a shop filled with every variety of apple under the sun, awesome jellies and jams, and a lovely assortment of fudge and treats. \n\nTrips out to Edwards Apple Orchards are one of the family traditions that we've really hung on to, though - now that I'm older - I can insist that my mom wait until 9:00 to pile us all into the car.",

            "description": "I would give this place 6 stars if I could.  \n\nI started coming here 3 or 4 years ago and every year I make a point to visit. Once September hits I start getting excited at the prospect of picking apples, selecting my own pumpkin, bundling up in warm clothes, and (most importantly) visiting Edward's Apple Orchard.  This orchard is about an hour west of where I live so the anticipation builds as we leave suburbia for a small town feel and country life.  \n\nThe layout is very well organized.  Ample parking + staff members to direct said parking = no parking headaches for this girl. The apple cider is some of the best I've ever had.  The apple cider donuts are soft, sweet, fresh, and oh so good.  My mouth is watering just thinking about them.  They have a store located inside a barn with tons of potential purchases including freshly made fudge (they let you sample it before you buy it... the amaretto is a must try), apple butter, crafts to make your home feel all cozy inside, candles, and so much more.  \n\nIf you go a little shopping crazy in the store you can easily end up spending more money than you intend to so, unless you're Mr/Mrs Moneybags, be prepared.   They have a variety of lunch and snack options (as a vegetarian I was a little limited to nachos and a baked potato stand with a variety of toppings to choose from but I'm used to it so I didn't mind) at very reasonable prices. \n\nIf \"choose you own\" is more your style you can mosey on out to the pumpkin patch to find your perfect pumpkin.  They also offer pick your own raspberry bushes. I seems like a cool idea (and they are delicious) but if you don't get them at the peak of freshness and before everyone picks them over be prepared to spend a LOT of time searching for decent berries. \n\nFinally, comes apple picking.  A word of advice - if you're looking for a specific kind of apple call ahead to see what  they're letting customers pick that day.  I forgot this and at our most recent visit my friends and I were hoping to get Red Delicious but since they were only letting people pick Golden Delicious we were a bit disappointed.  Regardless the ones we picked were DELICIOUS! There's nothing better than fresh fruit you pick yourself. \n\nThis place is awesome for people of all ages.

You are confined to a minuscule portion of the orchard crowded with people, given a basket you are required to buy ($3) and fill to the top ($30 - $35), and we only had access to a single apple type - gala.  And don't try to walk the 100yrds to or from the orchard. They don't want people clogging the road.\n\nBeen to several other orchards: Jonamac, all seasons, county line, this one was the worst.",

I'm not even joking, there were at least 50 people in line waiting to get into the area where you buy gifty/foody items. \n\nThe actual apple picking was fun and their trees had tons of apples, but the $34 minimum was pretty extreme. I've been going apple picking for years and never seen that kind of a minimum, or paid such a high price. The apple donuts were fantastic, but again, a good 15 minute wait in line (the smell got the better of me and I had to wait!). The apple cider was also good, but oops, they ran out in the middle of pouring our cups. We did have the option to go get into another 20 minute line for more. No way... we drank what we got. Sharing never killed anyone.\n\nIf you can make it here in the middle of the week it might be worth it, but steer clear on the weekends!",

Getting there early or when the weather is less than desirable helps.  The donuts are REALLY good.  We always get a dozen to eat and a dozen to freeze for later.  They have all their available apples ready for tasting.  I found I have a new favorite apple.... the Empire - you gotta taste one!  A slice of apple pie ale mode and hot cider is worth the wait in the long line.  On weekends you can listen to live music while you wait.

I enjoyed sitting in the barn, eating a BBQ pork sandwich with hot apple cider while listening to a bluegrass band. \n\nI took a short horse-drawn ride around the orchard for $3. Any opportunity to be pulled around by Clydesdales is fun, and the staff were very friendly, but I had hoped they'd drop us off at a pick-your-own outpost of some sort -- they didn't.\n\nOne of the main attractions appears to be the store. It's disappointing to spend that much time looking at trinkets and jars of jam when I'd hoped to spend a beautiful autumn day outside.

Not bad!  \n\nWe arrived and were kinda stunned at how crazy it was.  The last time I was there (when I was a kid), it was a small operation.  They've clearly hit the big time since then.  It was packed!  \n\nWe got on the tractor and headed out to the pick your own.  A note for other pickers - if you can, bring your own baskets for picking, otherwise you'll pay $3 for one of theirs.  They were picking Jonathans and Empires on the particular day we went out there.  The Jonathans were great - the trees weren't at all picked over and we filled up a basket pretty quickly!  The Empires weren't as good - the trees were a lot more picked over and there wasn't much left.  But we did well enough with the Jonathans that we were happy.\n\nThey also have a pick your own raspberry patch (which we skipped as my friend is allergic) and a pumpkin patch (where we found lots of little pumpkins for my friend's niece).  I think they may also have strawberries when they are in season, but don't quote me on that.  \n\nThere was a bluegrass band, big barn with lots of lunch-y type foods, a smaller snack shop with apple pie and apple donuts, and a shack that sold cider by the glass and bottles of water.  There were pony rides, hay rides, and lots of playgrounds for the kids.  Their country shop was amazing - lots of apple-themed products and yummy local foods made by farmers.  I picked up homemade vidalia dressing, sweetcorn salsa, and real cheese curds.  Yum!  It also sells pre-picked apples, so I took home two big bags full of honeycrisps.  \n\nAll in all we had a lot of fun here.  Next time I'd probably try to find somewhere that's less crowded and has a better variety of apples for u-pick, but if someone suggested it, I'd happily come back here for more apple fun!",

            "description": "On Sunday, we took a drive northward towards the Wisconsin border for a day of apple picking and general autumnal fun.  Our original destination was Royal Oak orchard in Harvard but since I couldn't be bothered to actually log onto their website, I didn't realize they don't open on Sundays.  I should've known because if you've ever been to Royal Oak, it's a beautiful place but they do kind-of hit you over the head with the bible the whole time you're there - my mother loves it.  So I tapped furiously on my Tom-Tom navigation device and found Edwards Apple Orchard.  The drive from Harvard, IL to Poplar Grove, IL is nice enough - we saw lots of farms and a handful of little villages; very Norman Rockwell.  Not knowing anything about Edwards and feeling slightly bummed that Royal Oak was closed, we crossed our fingers and hoped for a halfway decent afternoon.  Our expectations were met and exceeded by Edwards.\n\nThe place was hopping for a mid-September Sunday.  The parking situation wasn't too bad - they have parking on either side of Centerville Rd and they have cops there to make sure the whole operation moves efficiently and safely.  Once you get on the property, they have a lot of the same stuff they have at other farms - apple picking, pony rides, petting zoo, country store, tractor rides... you get the picture.  The one thing they don't do is take plastic.  We rarely have cash on us and use our debit card almost exclusively so this was a bit of an inconvenience.  They do have an ATM in the store which charges the very standard $1.50 per transaction.  I hated to do it but we had come so far and there probably wasn't a TCF bank anywhere in the vicinity, so I gritted my teeth and pulled out the cash.  The one thing Edwards does very well, compared with other orchards we have historically visited, is crowd control.  Does everyone go nuts for cider-donuts or is it just me?  Edwards makes you to stand in line and they have sacks of donuts ready to go.  At Royal Oak, Apple Holler, Didier Farms and almost everywhere else I can remember, it's a clusterf*** to get those donuts.  I don't know why we go so crazy for cider-donuts but it's one of those things I wait all year for and when a place like this makes it easy for me to get my fix, I appreciate it.  The rest of the store is like a giant Cracker Barrel which my wife loves - I had to hold my son so he wouldn't break anything.  A jar of honey, four taffy apples, two lollipops and a tub of caramel made our wallet $30 lighter but *DANG* those apples are so good.  So now you're armed with cash and can start 'having fun' - what else can you do?  They have a little area with farm animals - I called it a petting zoo but that's not accurate... you don't go in with the animals... they are in a barn and you can reach in and pet/feed them.  Don't bother buying any animal feed because these guys are so full that they usually sniff your hand and ignore the food.  That 'farm animal experience' doesn't cost anything - that's a freebie @ Edwards.  They have a playground with old tractors and slides for kids - also free.  There are lots of kids everywhere and their respective parents snapping pictures.  Next, we decided to take a Clydesdale drawn ride around the property and follow that up with a pony ride for the little ones - clearly the free fun ended here since both of those attractions run about $4 per person (expensive - no?).  Then we decided to do the actual apple picking.  They get you on a trailer (pulled by tractor) and explain that you must use one of their baskets (which you end up purchasing) and must fill it with at least $30 worth of apples - this is the minimum amount of apples you must purchase - if you take less than $30 worth of apples you still pay $30.  You won't know exactly how much your basket of apples will cost until it gets weighed later, but apparently you have to at least put $30 in there (or else).  I was slightly confused by the system, but it didn't really matter.  They drive you back to the orchard and tell you which apples you can pick - on this specific day, it was Jonathan and Jonagold apples.  Let me tell you these apples were absolutely magnificent.  You can fill a basket full of PERFECT apples in just a matter of minutes... I do like the apples here.  I don't have one of Royal Oak's apples to do a Pepsi challenge but I bet Edwards can hold their own.\n\nSo now we have a giant basket full of beautiful and delicious apples (of which we will sadly only eat maybe half).  I should be thankful that Royal Oak was closed on the day of our lord otherwise we may have never discovered Edwards orchard.",

Because it is also family-owned, it's family  feel is what brings us back every year!\n\nAs you approach the orchard with the car windows down, you are hit with the smell of their apple donuts.  On weekends, you can find a band playing while you sit in their picnic area and enjoy their hot or cold cider, barbeque pork sandwiches, baked potatoes, etc.  from their restaurants.\n\nYou are brought to the apples by a \"hay-less\" ride, I know some orchards allow you to drive through their orchards, but not this one.  One thing, they do have a variety of different kinds of apples to pick, but you have to know exact dates when they're available to pick or you'll just have to pick what they have on the day you go.  For example, I went yesterday, and we were hoping to pick some Gala Apples, but apparently they were harvested earlier in the month.  Therefore, we had to pick Golden and Red Delicious apples.  I also wish they had a petting zoo, and a corn maze, I know some others do.  \n\nLast but not least, it's not too far from the city, about an hour to an hour and a half.  Also, this place is VERY clean!!!

They do not accept credit or debit cards...  but do have ATM's on property if you don't mind paying the service charge for getting cash there.  It's big and has a few novelty attractions, but I didn't see much of a difference between this place and some of the smaller orchards in the area.  They all tend to have the same basics (play area, shop with items, fudge, cider, donuts, hay ride, etc.), which are really what most of us go to an orchard for.  I will say though, I didn't see a corn maze anywhere at this orchard.  People often say the donuts or cider tastes better from one orchard or another, but honestly, I'm not seeing it after visiting several orchards.  If we did a blind taste-test, I'm betting no one could tell the difference between any of them.  $30 - $35 to pick your own apples is way overpriced, even if it is \"just for the experience.\"  The place is OK, but if you have a local orchard, you're probably just as well off going there (especially if you are driving any distance to get to this one).",

There is a barn with lots of gourmet food goodies, halloween and fall craft/gift items, fresh fudge, apples galore and of course thier famous donuts which are to die for! I can't imagine leaving there without some honey crisps and a dozen donuts! Just know that they only accept cash and checks although I did see an atm machine nestled in a corner. Outside there is a pumpkin patch, farm animals and play area for the kids, tractors and even a horse drawn carriage trolley rides through the orchard. Check out the farm museaum in the eatery theres some cool things in there. Weekends are pretty busy but its really a great place to be enjoyed! There was also a band playing outdoors which helped add to the atmosphere. Can't wait to go back next fall!\nI wish there were more signs on the road to direct you or show you where to turn because we nearly passed Centerville Rd.",

            "description": "The apples are excellent and the fresh apple cinnamon donuts are addicting.  No matter how many donuts I purchase, they rarely survive the trip home.  Placing them in the trunk might be a suggestion for those who actually want to have some the next day. Having gone here for decades, it would seem their prices have increased far beyond the rising prices in today's economy. Perhaps it is supply and demand. I have often said about food 'if it is good, I don't care about the cost.'  Edwards has reached the point where I limit my visits to once a year versus several each year simply because the costs have really gone beyond an acceptable level. Another problem is they use cute baskets which do not hold more than two bags of apples, unless you want to bounce them on the floor several times.  If you are disabled or physically challenged, bring a helper, as you will not be able to manage carrying anything if you use a cane and the very few benches are usually occuppied by donut eaters and kids, so there is no place for the physically challenged.  They do have ample handicapped parking, but it would seem to be filled by those affluent people from the suburbs with handicapped parking permits who seem to be free of disabilities.",
