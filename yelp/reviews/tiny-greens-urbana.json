            "description": "Tiny Greens sells their wonderful organic produce through Wal-Mart, and at some area farmers markets, and probably more places I don't know about yet.  This is a wonderful company.  The main man, Bill, is extremely devoted to sustainability and environmental/ecological responsibility.\n\nThe company is all about bringing locally sourced, healthy products at affordable prices.  The farm market for Urbana, close to my home, has a booth.  I've tried sprouts, micro-greens, and sprouted wheat tortillas.  All were absolutely amazing, flavorful.  The kind of food you can pig out on and feel really good about afterwards.\n\nI try to spend my hard-earned on products from this kind of company.  It's difficult because there are so few.  Tiny Greens is one of those truly progressive companies, and I'm happy they're around!",
