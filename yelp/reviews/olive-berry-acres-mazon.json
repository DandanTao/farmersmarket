            "description": "First time picking strawberries. Staff was super helpful, explained the heat this spring made the berries smaller. They were still delicious! Got 5 quart bucket for $12, took about 45 min with 2 adults and 2 very young kids to collect the bucket. They had lemonade to purchase which tasted great when we finished picking. Would definitely go back, a no frills place with delicious strawberries!",

            "description": "Strawberries were a bit picked over by this time, but there were still plenty to be found. We were concerned with how the ground would be since it had rained consistently overnight, but with straw covering the rows between plants it was a pleasant surprise. Raspberries should be ready in a couple of weeks and I think we'll be returning for that. Overall a well run family establishment. No frills, but who needs em?",
