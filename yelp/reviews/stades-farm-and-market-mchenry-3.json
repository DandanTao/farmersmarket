During the fall they have amazing little stand s with great corn and the best cheese curds!  They even have a section for kids with activity to do!  The prices are excellent as well for their vegetables just a great local place!",

There are tractor rides that take you to and from the apple orchard there are virtually no outrageous wait times which I was anticipating , especially being there on the weekend. \n\nThe apple  donuts are FANTASTIC ! The variations of apples are limited and the honey crisp apples that I absolutely love were not as sweet as I have had from other apple picking farms and this is the only reason why I gave them 4 stars. I surely still would be back in the future , they are closer to my home than the other farm I normally go to.",

            "description": "We had a great experience during peak 2018 strawberry season.  Follow them on Facebook to know when the optimal time to visit for U-pick.  It took us about an hour to fill two 4-quart buckets between 1.5 adults.  Came here on a hot Sunday before noon, and the parking wasn't too bad (on a grassy lot) or too far from the strawberry field (bring a stroller for toddlers or younger).  \n\nTo enter the U-pick fields, you purchase your buckets first ($4 for 1 quart, $7 for 2 quarts, $13 for 4 quarts), then there's someone instructing you where to go and how to pick.  Strawberries grow on low bushes, so you'll need to be prepared to squat and bend down for long periods of time.  You'll need to brush away leaves in order to find strawberries hiding by the ground away from the sun.  You want them to be fully red and firm (not partially white or soft), and pluck them with the cap & stem still on.  \n\nThere's a gravel path leading to the field, and then you're off!  I suggest hopping in a few rows because the main aisles are usually picked over.  They line the rows with straw, but there's still mud underneath.  It had rained a lot days leading up to the weekend we went, so we could feel the soft mud underneath our feet, and our shoes got a little muddy still.  Bring water to drink and wear loose or stretchy clothing, sunscreen, and washable shoes.  For toddlers or younger who might get worn out and want to sit down or fall a lot, I suggest dressing them in long pants and washable shoes, and bring a change of clothes for the car ride home.  Our LO's pants was stained in mud and strawberry juices by the end. \n\nOn your way out, they check your bags and such so that you're not sneaking anything out that you didn't pay for.  Then you'll pass by a concession stand selling brats, hotdogs, and refreshments, and a large tented area with picnic tables.  Great for grabbing lunch before you leave.  Right by the parking lot, there's an indoor market that sells produce, jams, doughnuts, and slushees.  Lastly, there are portable toilets outside, and most likely bathrooms inside the market.\n\nAs for how they taste, I've only gone strawberry picking one other time near Portland, OR, and those strawberries were MUCH sweeter.  These are sweeter than the grocery store but not as sweet as I had hoped.  However, they are all surprisingly nicely shaped and look picture-perfect, unlike the ones at the grocery store.",

The ladies collecting your money up front were very nice. $13 for a larger basket of strawberries is a little pricy but it's fine because it's all about the experience here. We picked like 3 of the large baskets full of strawberries in about an hour and then took them\nHome. I must say that they aren't as sweet as I would have liked them to be so I made strawberry jam with them. I feel like the ones we usually pick at Thompson strawberry farm are a little smaller but also sweeter as a breed. But I'm willing to give them\nAnother shot in the future and maybe come back in the fall months for the pumpkin patch type of activities. \n\nStade's you definitely had a lot of strawberries and they were tasty but not one of the better ones we've had in Chicago.",

Excuse my French, but the lady manning down that station is a bizzzznatch. She rolled her eyes, spoke under her breath a couple times (I think I heard her say... these people are idiots), and made some smart remarks. Maybe she had a tough day? Constipated? Or maybe had diarrhea?? Who knows. But whatever was up her ass was coming out with awful customer service. The corn stand people were nice though and the raspberries were sweet. Had it been for that rude ladies remarks, I'd have given a much higher review.",

We bought nice large ones for $8 and $9 each, along with some smaller ones. I really wanted to pick apples, but the kids had their eyes set on going into the theme park. For $15 a person, ages 3 and up, I say it was well worth it. We did almost all the activities they had available from the pillow jump, to pedal tractors, to zip lines, sand digging, trailer maze, along with a corn maze, to a carousel, corn bin, and a few more (too much to name). We manage to spend almost 5 hours there, which was definitely not the plan, but glad we did. I'm hoping to go back to pick some apples before the season ends. And the family and I will definitely visit again next fall. \n\nSide note- If you're hungry, you must get the corn, kettle corn, and cider donuts. You can also stop in the market to stock up on fresh produce and baked goods.",

The staff there was not friendly at all, we paid for our buckets and they didn't tell us where the strawberry patch was located. We just followed the people in front of us.  No big deal I thought at first, but after we were done picking.  We decided to go inside their store.  As soon as we came in, we had a shadow watching our every move, he made us feel very uncomfortable!  \nMaybe it's that we didn't look like the rest of the people there, or they have a high theft in there store. But all I know that he didn't stop watching us until we paid, and even then he was by the front door!! As he was waiting for us to leave to make sure we didn't steal anything as we left.  A terrible experience, we will not be going back!",

Apple cider donuts are delicious, warm and fresh.  We picked 5 pumpkins, each one was at least 30 pounds.  Stades is going to be a tradition for us from here forward.  The love and care that these folks have dedicated to the place is evident and something I value and respect.   Inside the market we purchased home grown beets and cucumbers, he beets were the size of a softball and amazingly sweet!  So happy to give them my business and refer friends and family alike.

I thought that the number of cars was an indication that the experience was going to be overcrowded and frustrating.  Surprisingly, that was not the case.  I also thought that the berries would be picked over...that too was not the case.  It was a little difficult finding areas where there were an abundance of berries, but we were able to find enough to fill up our baskets.  The prices were right and they don't have the over abundance of extra \"carnival\" type attractions.  They keep it simple and let you get a true farm experience and don't make you over pay for it.  We left with four baskets of strawberries, a dozen of donuts and a couple waters and spent around 30 bucks for a day of fun in sun.",

Strawberries and Sugar snap peas in late June/July.  \n\nWhats to say about a u-pick farm this one is one I will return to!  \n\nParking is plentiful and free, but I felt bad about parking on the nice grass field.  \n\nSend the kids to the giant combine setup for pictures on one side and a neat modified tube slide down the other side.  This would help with just getting the kids to stretch after the quaint drive to the farm.  There is a for fee play area available as well.  \n\nLike them on FB as they update regularly on whats ripe for picking.   They also do raspberries which were later in the season, and corn as well I think.  \n\nAs all u-picks, they have a giant barn with the usual pie kits, apple / strawberry donuts, cider...but oh if its a hot day, treat yourself to a frozen slush strawberry lemonade flavor oh yum!  You will thank yourself!\n\nPricing is $3 min per person, and you have a number of choices for sizes of containers.  Tip:  don't just pick strawberries, no matter how sweet or good they were, I got sick of eating them.  Get variety if there is any other crops available at the time.  \n\nSugar snaps were quite nice, just remember to remove the string strands before cooking or prepping your salads.  \n\nQuality of the pick:\nThere were scant large strawberries left in the patch by the time I swung on by.   But the trick is to find super red ones, as those are the sweetest as well. \n\nSugar snaps were fantastic.  But super hard to find amongst the plant since the pods were camo'd.  \n\nApparently they have worship service in the outdoor shelter in the back, so its a great place to worship and then pick on a Sunday morning!

The market, the vegetables, the fruits, the baked goods, the pumpkins, the Indian corn, the mums, the decor, the activities, the parking, etc. I don't have little kids anymore, so I didn't do the little-kid things, but they're amazing to watch. Everyone is having a ball here. One note, parents with little kids, Stade's is too big to fit everything in before nap time. Pick one thing like the tractor or train out to the pumpkin patch, trudge around in the dirt for a bit, get and pay for your pumpkins, get an apple donut and cider, and call it a day. As the kids get older, you can head over to the east side and checkout more and more. Their baked goods are on the dry side--zucchini bread, orange cranberry bread, and apple bread. They're expensive so it's worth pointing out to my many fellow yelpers!",

Such a nice place to have so close to home in our little towns and such a popular attraction to be known for in our town! Great priced pumpkins and the the pumpkin shooters are great to watch! By far the best pumpkin farm anywhere!!!\n\nVisited October 2016",

Plenty of things to do for the entire family, and the attractions were spread out over a very large area to help with crowding issues.  Customer service was great, and the facilities were clean.  The owner even stopped to chat with us, you could really tell he wanted to make sure everyone was having a good time.  \n\nWe will definitely be back soon!",

We decided that for a family outing that Stade's would be a good place to try. It was very organized and great for our family. There are many activities for kids and lots of food if you get hungry. The apple cider donuts were fresh and delicious! Pumpkins are very reasonable and you pick yourself, which in and of itself is a very fun activity (great photo opportunity as well).",

They had a whole section that was $10 a person to enter. There was tons of great attractions & Halloween themed things to do & we wanted to do them but an hour wasn't enough, plus we asked if it was still full price for an hour & they said yes - disappointing. So we took the kids in the area were music was playing & the food was. We let the kids run around & took pictures. We bought a small bag of kettle corn for $5 & it feed 2 adults & 4 kids & it was delicious!!!!!!!\nWe walked to store but didn't really buy anything. Lots of great veggies to chose from. I thought I had read they were a dairy farm too so I was bummed to see no milk for sale. It's a cute little farm so I would check it out again, just not an hour before close.",

Their strawberry lemonade was also very delicious. We ran out of time and weren't able to go to the children's play area where they have a petting zoo and some other fun things to keep the kids busy.

Needless to say, strawberry picking is rather nostalgic for me. \n\nStade's helped me relive my childhood strawberry picking days. Everything about the experience was 5 stars. The staff was over the top friendly and helpful, there were hundreds of rows of ripe strawberry plants, and the prices were right. For $1.99/lb you could pick your own and for $2.99/lb you could buy the pre-picked (which is no fun in my book). \n\nThere's also a quaint market where you can pick up other fresh vegetables, homemade jams and jellies, apple donuts, and a variety of other local farm stand goods. \n\nYes, McHenry is far for us Western 'burbs dwellers but you can guarantee I'll be back next year - and every year after. \n\n5 massive, solid stars.",

There were 3 large strawberry fields where we could wander around and pick berries. They were also offering you-pick-em sugar snap peas in fields a little further away. I thought the prices for the strawberries were pretty reasonable. (1.75 per lb for the you-pick-em strawberries) \n\nThe shop offers donuts, including the every popular cider donuts (YUM!), coffee, cold sodas and strawberry drinks. You can also purchase fresh pints of strawberries if you don't feel like picking--along with all the fixings for strawberry shortcake. There's also a play area for the kiddos--tractor toys, petting zoo, bubble trampoline, slides and other playground equipment with a barnyard twist \n\nThe staff is very helpful and friendly. The shop and farm was well-maintained. Picnic tables in the shade, clean bathroom trailers. \nI know in the fall, Stade's becomes more of a pumpkin patch. \nWell worth a visit up to McHenry!",

Even though the prices have gone up, it's still a deal compared to places like Goebert's (Barrington)or Apple Holler in WI. We used to take my son to Apple Holler when he was small and we lived in WI. We returned to find they charge you close to $ 20 per person to get in. It used to be you could buy a bag and pick apples. Now you can't even pick apples unless you buy their crazy pass and pay for apples on top of it. My kids love the corn maze at Stade's. They also love the pumpkin cannon, slides and bounce pillows. There is also more than enough parking, and it's free.( I'm looking at you Apple Holler)The store has awesome donuts and pies.",
