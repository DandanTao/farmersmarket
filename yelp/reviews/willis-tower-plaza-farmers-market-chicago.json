I wish they were free! But be nice, and they'll toss in an extra peach! \n\nThere are a few vendors with cooked food you can get for lunch, too.\n\nI like the Mother/Son flower vendors from St. Anne- same ones as at the Logan Square Farmer's Market. Buy some nice flowers for that someone special...on Thursday!",
