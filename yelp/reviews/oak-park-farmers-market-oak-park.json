            "description": "I've been coming to Oak Park Farmers Market for 20 years and every year it has improved upon itself and expanded to offer more and more delicious and unique things like cheese, bread, honey and jams/sauces in addition to standard fresh fruits, plants, flowers and vegetables. \n\nI'm one of the few people who don't actually care for the donuts themselves but I do love how Pilgrim Church shares the donut sale proceeds with so many awesome community non-profits. I also love the gathering of talented folk musicians who come out each Saturday to play near the donut stand! The musicians were gone by the time I arrived at 12:30 today so be sure to come early if you want donuts, music and the full variety of stands open. About a third were already sold out or broken down by 12:35 which is a shame since I can never get to the market before that time due to a class this year. \n\nFinding nearby metered street parking can be a challenge but if you park a few blocks away and walk in to the market you should be ok.",

            "description": "I just attended the Farmer's Market this morning. I like this market, I have gone several times a year for a few years. \nAlthough there are quite a few vendors, the vendors and products are the same each time and each year. There are seasonal items which is great. \nI would like to see a little more in the way of food products you can snack on while walking through the market. \nAlso, I'm never entirely sure why Carnivore isn't in there. Carnivore supports local farmers and I usually wind up buying a lot of produce after I shop there. \nI would like to see a bit more variety. \nIt is a nice market though, it's run well. \nI consistently by chocolate croissants from Katie's and flowers from the Stand in the south/east corner of the lot. \nThere are lots of parking options and it's right down the street from a lot of shops and restaurants. I do recommend going early.",

All excellent! I'm not sure if the donuts are more popular than the items from farms.\n\nNormally, I come to get fresh honey and a few fruits. The oak park community turns out every weekend for the market and you will often bump into neighbors....make sure you've wiped the powdered sugar off your moth.\n\nPrices can be a bit high. But, feels good to support real farmers making real food.\n\nDid I mention donuts?",

It opens early so I recommend getting there early (b 4 11am)before everything is sort of picked over. The selection of vendors/area farmers ranges from fresh fruit to flowers to salsa, jellies, olive oil and meats.  Don't forget to stop by the donut booth where local businesses/churches/groups host every week and proceeds are then donated. The donuts are phenomenal!! There is also usually an eclectic group of musicians of all ages jamming together during the market hours. It's convenient that most vendors accept credit cards and of course cash. I believe you can use link cards too.",

Anyway, OP farmers market at the Pilgrim Baptist Church is famous for their homemade donuts which you gotta wake up real early in the morning to get...seriously! *Sidenote: Do not buy a couple of donuts and take to work! Even if you put your name on them, some idiot will steal them!*  It's that good. \n\nLast year I went I tried a sample of this cranberry salsa from a farmer from Michigan. It was so good, I went back and bought another jar and saved it for Thanksgiving. I also bought a bunch of golden beets, I never had them before. They're good for roasting and putting in a veggie taco! \n\nSo OP farmers market is great for their selections and location...",

From residents playing folk music and singing to all the smell of cinnamon and sugar home made donuts!! Usually a line for the donuts but well worth the wait.  There's tree types of homemade donuts : plain, cinnamon and sugar, or powdered sugar. My all time favorite market in the area.  Really good selection of fruits and veggies stands. Also fresh baked goods and cheese vendors, jellies and sweets.  My favorite things to buy are the fresh flowers that are offered at a really good price and last a long time since they are fresh cut. It's very family friendly and great for bringing he wagon to carry the kids and goodies you buy. There's always parking and easy to get to. Too bad the weather in Chicago only allows the market to go from May to October.",

It is like your average Farmers' Market times at least two.  Any fruit or vegetable you want, it is here, in triplicate.  Plus, unlike my town, they do not allow dogs so you can walk around without any barking or dog poo to avoid.  Perfect!\n\nI know what you are thinking, hmmm, Kathleen does not usually get quite this sentimental about produce, there must be something else going on here.\n\nFine, yes, there is.  The donuts.  The ambrosia that is sold hot, fresh and in a sugary circle of fantastic flavor.  Those cinnamon donuts are the stuff dreams are made of.\n\nI can't wait for this Farmers' Market to start up again.

What most isn't: ORGANIC or NON-GMO.  \n\nWith the type of clientele that Oak Park provides a market like this, I would expect a bit more in terms of value (like getting organic non-gmo produce for the prices charged here normally.)

            "description": "This is as good as a farmer's market gets if you live near the area.  Although it's not as diverse as some great markets on the Pacific Northwest or West Coast, it provides a good selection.\n\nOn that note, the selection is NOT created equal.  I recommend walking around once before you purchase.  You will see that although their website states they are \"organic\", not everything sold here (produce wise) is organic.  I don't do GMO's, chemical spraying, and the like but you have to ASK the families because I found that after asking this year (2013) almost all, with the exception of 3 booths sprayed pesticides and in some cases, also fungicides.  That is NOkay in my house.\n\nThere is a booth that sells grass-fed cow/goat cheese, spreads, butter, and ice cream that is AMAZING.  And although there are two booths selling meats this year (that I saw), only one of them is grass-fed (Heartland Meats), and even they said that they supplemented in the last 3 months before slaughter with grain, yet couldn't tell me if it was genetically modified grain??  I figure, 3 months of fattening on the grain, but a lifetime before that pastured, I will compromise and okay that meat.  Plus, I appreciated that he took the time to talk to me, answer my questions and inquiries regarding feed, gmo's, and purchasing in quarters.  Which is more than I can say for the other booth that handed me a brochure after my questions that included only pricing.\n\nMy favorite family booth is Tree of Life.  They have wonderful, quality, beautiful produce and the two of them are seriously the most friendly people I have ever met.  They answered all my questions...they are completely organic, no chemical spraying, and they have a CSA (community share agreement) if you want to buy boxes weekly.\n\nAll in all, I frequent this market every weekend.  And past reviews also state they only accept cash.  However, they except credit cards at some booths and others that don't will give you a receipt to go to the \"yellow\" tent and they will ring up the sale for you.  You can then return to the booth of purchase, hand them the paid receipt and pickup your goods. \n\nAlso, in an attempt to help those who are having hard times and unemployed, this farmer's market will also accept the IL Link card.  You pick out your goods and return to the \"yellow\" tent with your receipt, pay with your Link and then return to pick up your goods.  Additionally, because you purchased REAL food from a farmer's market, in lieu of junk at a grocery store, you also are awarded a match coupon for every dollar you spend up to $20.  You spend $20 on your Link card you get another $20 in coupons to spend at this farmer's market.  That's $40 of fresh produce for $20 off the Link card.  I think that this a wonderful incentive to help steer people to REAL food in lieu of soda's, chips, and junk.  I don't know how long that goes on, I just asked about the program because I saw the signs.",

Most of the veggies and fruits were sold for $3 to $5 per pound, being not organic, that's ridiculously expensive for what they are. You can get non-organic fresh produce at Jewel for much less, and I guarantee you they taste the same. Locally grown is NOT the same as organic, and should not be charged as equals at this farmers market. The selection wasn't that great either, just your standard tomatoes, zucchinis, green beans, and fruits like cherries and peaches. The baked goods are great though, since you can actually taste the difference between home made and store bought. Don't get me wrong, I would love to support the local farmers, but they are just charging too much for what it is.",

Though it's sized to be large enough to attract people from outside of the immediate Oak Park area, it still feels extremely communal and relationship based.  Just check out the middle schooler selling water bottles just outside of the farmer's market grounds, or the adorable 6-year-old down the street whose mother sits on their front porch watching from afar as her business-minded daughter sells lemonade.  It's sweet and quaint, but crowd serving.\n\nAnd can we talk about the donuts?  Oh the donuts, oh...oh...oh....Ok, I'm done moaning about their goodness now though my tummy is still craving one.  And I'm not beyond the irony about the deliciousness of donuts at a farmer's market, but when you have one, you'll never go again and not get one.

The Market has had a long time to become what it is, and what it is is great.  \n\nMy favorite is Nichols' Farm, with the yellow bins -- tons of different varieties of tomatoes, potatoes and apples in the fall.  Nichols' shows up at markets around Chicago -- you can always recognize them by the bin color.  Farmers are always set up at their usual spots, everybody's always got the most lovely stuff come August.  Great market, and an OP institution.",

And it is local and sustainable and incredibly fresh and delicious.  My favorite haul comes about midsummer when the tables and tables of incredibly colorful heirloom tomatoes begin to appear.

            "description": "Commentary on a couple other posts...\n\n1. RE: complaints that the market not that big or doesn't offer that much variety (e.g. in a review posted in June of 2008).  It is true that in the early part of the summer, there isn't much variety.  By July and August, the selection really increases.  This is all part of the natural growing season.  You can buy what is coming out of the ground at the time.  While some might find it inconvenient, I like to eat what is fresh now within driving distance.  It's not ALL I eat, but at least I think I'm a little more in touch with the land that feeds me.\n\n2. Red Hen Bakery is back in 2009, and is also opening a shop on Lake St. and Oak Park Ave.\n\n3. RE: prices.  Some prices are higher than at big grocery stores, but not higher than organic, locally farmed produce you'll find elsewhere (and food at Whole Foods isn't as local as it appears).  The thing is, the reason that big grocery stores ship food all around the planet is largely because it is cheaper to do so!  Or they wouldn't do it (or they would really jack up the prices for strawberries in December).  Quality of produce and high labor standards are sacrificed for the sake of cost-reduction.\n\nThe value you get at the OP market is not from lower prices (because really, it costs money for the farmer's employees to drive to OP and sit there in a tent making change all morning--they wouldn't have to do that if they were to sell everything to Whole Foods for example), but from knowing more about your food, when and where it came from, who harvested it, etc...\n\nAnd yes, the donuts still rock.",

It gets really really really crowded. Ideally, you should be done by 9am. Plus, you don't have to pay the meters until 9am anyways. Go do your shopping and then come home and take a nap!\n\nI wish the market was a lot more spread out because it gets pretty crowded and hot in there, even though it's an open air market.",

I always stop shopping and listen for a bit.\n\nLast year the chef from Trattoria 225 started doing the occasional cooking demo here.

This is a small community Farmer's Market in a Church parking lot on Saturday mornings and has been going strong for 30 years!\n\nThis is what small community farmers markets are supposed to be like.  I can ALWAYS be sure to run into a neighbor or friend of my parents (yes I grew up in Oak Park), or even the odd old classmate.  Has the selection gone down in the past years?  Yes, but from what I understand (talking to some of the VERY FRIENDLY growers) alot of that has to do with the fact that the US has been going through rapid changes in weather that has affected the farmers; drought, light winters and cool summers.  I have noticed that there are fewer venders as in the past.  Possibly, many suburbs have started to follow Oak Park's example and started up their own Summer Farmer's Markets.  \n\nAs for the doughnuts, as stated by a past poster they might not be the best tasting ones out there but the fact that the money collected goes to various community groups makes them taste that much better! Oh, and the inch layer of sugar helps too.\n\nNow, on to the complaints of prices.  Anytime you plan to purchase organic, \"picked fresh\", ripe produce you will pay more.  That is one of the reasons people love farmers markets over Jewel (or even Whole Foods).  Here you know that the produce was just picked and has not ripened on a truck crossing the country.  Also I don't mind paying more for the expertise of the farmers.  I have often received great recipes and advice on how to best prepare the produce right from the people who grow it!  To me that is worth a bit of money.\n\nNow if you want a jumbo sized farmers market, by all means head over to Green market.  If you want to experience a wonderfully friendly community market with really good doughnuts, good coffee, bluegrass jams, a fantastic flower section stop by the Oak Park Farmers Market.  Oh and how could we all forget the roasted corn!  Fantastic roasted fresh corn!",

You might be standing for a half hour or more if you don't get there early enough. But the smell will hit you as soon as you step out of your car--no, as soon as you drive by, and it won't leave you alone until the donut's in your mouth. \n\nThey have cinnamon and powdered sugar varieties, but the donut base is so damn good that none of that stuff is necessary. It takes everything in my power to keep moving and not cause a human traffic blockage when I take the first  bite. It's a religious experience. A small gift from a power higher than anything we walk among on a daily basis. I sound dramatic, I know. But I am in no way kidding. This thing is from another world, and the market becomes a blurry haze around me when I stand still, taking bites slowly from the opaque wax paper bag. Time stops.

I love living in OP, the families and kiddies in red wagons really make it feel like summer.  \n\nI primarily shop at the market to support my raging flower habit!  Check out the flower stand on the north end by the dough nuts.  They have a lot of lilies and glads and flowers to make interesting bouquets.  I also browse around for good-looking in produce.  This year has been a little meager, but for your choice of produce, go early.   \n\nOccasionally I get the delicious dough nuts and enjoy the music.

NOT EVEN SLIGHTLY local (OK - Holland, Michigan is over five hours away. That's about the CLOSEST farmer you'll find there. There are parts of central Ohio, Nebraska, and Tennessee that are closer), and d.) if you think this is superior produce, I only half want your drugs because - though you're undeniably happy delusional - you're just beyond lost in happy land. What is with the drool fest on the donuts? They are deep fried donuts that you can get pretty much anywhere that people actually bake and understand the concept of \"baking\". Are we talking about an actual farmers market or what a very privileged community wants to imagine a \"farmers market\" to be? Where I grew up, there were actual farmers markets and THEY got well deservered criticism for being overpriced. Their prices did not hold a candle to the stones that the OP farmers market shows. I found a $9 half pint of blueberies in blueberry season, and the blueberries were from CALIFORNIA. So I gotta think at some level we're not talking about farms or markets, but luxury good and conspicuous consumption Well, hell, I can go to Dean and Deluca's if I want to show what a wealthy and indiscriminate twit I am.

Yet, these small farms must drive here, harvest their crops, etc. they cannot compete with the chain grocery stores so you may pay a little more. As one other reviewer suggested  buying strawberries from the back of a truck parked on Austin, I hope she/he enjoys their shopping at those locations.  This market has been running for many years, does it get crowded-yes, are there a gazillion strollers-yes, can it be expensive-yes ... but if you don't like crowds go early, same for strollers and if you feel the pricing is high shop elsewhere.  There are wonderful donuts and coffee, entertaining music by local groups, and fresh produce some organic (and no it isn't more costly than Whole Foods-I don't think any place is).  As all Farmers Markets it is part produce shopping and part meet and greet.  Have fun and enjoy the experience.",

I expected the market to be larger with more vendors and it was small but sort of spread out to look like more, no really great deals, and nothing really stood out to me. A few people had jam and jars of salsa but only about two vendors. I was ready to stock up on fruits and veggie, and home made goodness but nothing! Think I'll check out a couple of the city ones.",

I love the market for it's variety of items and for the way it seems to bring the community together. People just come OUT for this thing and it's great to take in the hustle and bustle. Of course, having to deal with the hustle and bustle all morning gets a little tiresome and then I start to wish the whole thing would go away. :)\n\nBut this market seems expensive. I have been to other farmers markets in other areas and other states  - and maybe this is just an artifact of living in this area - but this one seems really pricey to me. I'd love to support it more, but truthfully we are not really able to afford the fruit prices. The vegetable prices seem a little more reasonable, but the fruit prices can sometimes boggle the mind. I am always amazed when those frugal tips websites suggest shopping at a farmers market to save money because on the weeks that we have done so, we seem to spend more. \n\nThis leaves me in a quandary. I buy what I can from the market and then find the other products elsewhere. I wish I could do more to support the products and the farmers, but it is out of our budget. I realize that they have to turn a profit, but sometimes I wonder if there is a bit of price inflation because of the assumption that all the people in Oak Park are pretty well off in terms of disposable income. As I said, I've been to less expensive farmers markets where I really was able to save money. \n\nThe doughnuts? Very good. They have the taste and feel of being homemade and that is a nice change of pace from a chain store doughnut.",

Not huge, and not a ton of variety (we do miss the farmers' market in Union Square in NYC), but the smell of the doughnuts in the air is heavenly!  Since everyone else seems to have opined about the doughnuts, I feel obligated, being a bit of a donuttophile myself-- not my favorite style (cake), but a very good representation of the breed.

The juxtaposition of a huge array of fresh fruits and vegetables and DONUTS in the morning on a Saturday is amusing -- shall I munch on a honey crisp or a white carrot OR a cinnamon donut?  the donut usually wins.   the sweet corn is overflowing at the front table, but it's worth elbowing your way in for a spot to pick out your choice cobs.  all the fruits and vegetables here are locally grown and picked recently.  You can find some unique and interesting items that you may have never seen before -- odd varieties of onions, radishes, carrots, apples, etc. etc. and samples abound.  In addition there are many premade items (salsas, pickled things, sauces, dips, marinades), dairy, meats, juices, plants and flowers available.    there's an aging hippy jammy banjo-y band that plays near the donut line.  I'm not into it but it can be interesting for the kids, I guess.",
