This market features several vendors with fruits and veggies, cheeses, spices, jellies, jams, breads and pastries, fresh flowers and plants, jewelry and other accessories, clothing, cosmetics, storage products, and even freshly made popcorn.  

We bought the most delicious smelling and tasting tomatoes at this market.  We will be back next week!  However, there weren't any organic produce.  

The market takes place every Wednesday from 7am-1pm and it is located next to the Oak Lawn Public Library and it runs through mid October.Great farmers and local vendors from the area. Get there early to get the best selection. Support your local farmers and vendors who attend this market to promote their businesses. TIP: If you can, get the Honey Crisp apples before they are sold out in the Fall!
