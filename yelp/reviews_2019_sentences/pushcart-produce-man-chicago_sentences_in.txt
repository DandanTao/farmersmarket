This guy is mobile and I'm not sure whether he is here every Sunday, but he sold me about four pounds of jalapenos, very hot red peppers, limes, an onion, a tomatillo, and the  big dark green chile arbol whose name escapes me, all for $3.  He lets you pick your own out of the bins, and while it's all reasonably fresh you can select the freshest.  He concentrates on peppers but also has cactus. This is the perfect consolation prize for missing the thrice-removed New Maxwell Street market because you got too absorbed poking around vintage clothing places and the like and it got too late.  He's also a really nice young man.
