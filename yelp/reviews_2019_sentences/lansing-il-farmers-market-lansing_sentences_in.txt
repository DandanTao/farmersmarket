This is the information provided that I could find, "Open air market, very visible on the corner of Ridge & Grant Street in downtown Lansing, IL near the clock tower. A variety of market items are sold including but not limited to produce, eggs, jams, labriola breads, baked goods, and homemade dog treats. Dinners/cooked food items are available for purchase each week, providing an opportunity for our shoppers and vendors to purchase dinner while at the market. A local restaurant is featured on the second Wednesday of each month and craft vendors are featured on the first Wednesday of each month."

In our experience there are lots of great fresh veggies, amazing cheese, great breads, and a variety of other foods and drinks. There are also beautiful and inexpensive crafts. It's a very friendly and welcoming atmosphere. Our little one was in heaven and that is ALWAYS a plus for us!!
