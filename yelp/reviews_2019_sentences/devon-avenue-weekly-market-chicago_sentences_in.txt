I was so stoked to see that one of those trendy farmers market thingies was coming to my neighborhood.  Its there weekly on Wednesdays from 4-8pm in the parking lot at the Republic Bank.

I went to the grand opening on 7-8-14, and left barely 15 minutes after arriving.  

 Vendors included a couple bakeries, a raw milk dairy, a couple local restaurants, and an artist selling kitschy stuff.  Nothing much in the way of fresh produce, but they did have $5 pints of organic raspberries.  No thanks.  There was supposed to be live entertainment, but I didn't see any.  

One is much better off strolling Devon avenue just up the street in the brick and mortar markets that are there everyday.  You'll find much better selections and prices.
