Cute little farmers market.... But shame on you New lenox... You've got Frankfort to compete with!! You've got to step it up!!

There are booths at Frankfort's farmers as big as your entire market!?!?

I have however got some super fresh Morels at this tiny market...

Let's bring our A game in 2014!!!Nothing local, and the entire thing is about the size of my living room.  Good stuff, but tiny.  I went expecting to spend a nice morning with my kids, and instead I was driving home about 15 minutes later.  Let's step up our game next year!!New year and it still SUCKS!  I am so disappointed about this too.  There is truly nothing else to say.Only one produce booth and not local. Where is the community? A waste of time.
