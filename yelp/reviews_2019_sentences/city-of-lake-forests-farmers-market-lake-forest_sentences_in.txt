It's end of the season and there are still some great looking vegetables, flowers and more. This is a nice quiet time to get some great buys. 

I like the small size of this farmer's market. It's accessible by train. There is the McClory bike path right next to it. And plenty of parking. 

Great places in lake forest for coffee and a nosh after you peruse the market.Very nice Farmers Market on Saturdays with a selection of produce, baked goods and other offerings. Interestingly enough, neighboring Lake Bluff still has a better farmers market (on Fridays), but Lake Forest is catching up.
