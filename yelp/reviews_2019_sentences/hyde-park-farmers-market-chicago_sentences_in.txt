Hyde Park Farmers market is fantastic. Usually, have some live entertainment right in the middle of Harper Square, every Thursday through October.  Local venders are eager to give you the info. Plenty vegan choices of course.  Everyone takes credit cards. Today I got a bag of fruit and big bag of veggies including Swiss chard, kale, peppers for about ten bucks. I'll be back.
