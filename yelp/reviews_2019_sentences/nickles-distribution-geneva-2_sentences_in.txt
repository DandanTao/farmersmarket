was at farmer's market today around Bartlett area, purchase some ground beef with buffalo flavor, and some organic eggs.
the guy was very friendly and nice, and did answer most of my questions about buying 1/2 or 1/4 of a cow.
but their site is not working, couldn't check more informations on it, hopefully it will be up soon.
