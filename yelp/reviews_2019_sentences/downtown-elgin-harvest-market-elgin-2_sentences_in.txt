FINALLY you went back to reasonable hours! For several years you've held this on a Thursday afternoon. However, unless one was retired, unemployed, or actually worked in your hometown of Elgin (and had enough time to run over during the lunch hour) there was no chance for Elginites to be able to take advantage of our own local farmer's market! Thank you for bringing it back to a Friday afternoon/evening so that many of us can now get home from our work commute with enough time to go downtown to enjoy the, albeit small but eclectic, market to purchase fresh organic items in our own home town.The DNA Harvest Market is in a great location. Perfect spot to stop when out enjoying the Fox River Bike Trail.

My favorite part of the market is the food trucks and cheese vendors. I know they always have at least one food truck and one to two cheese vendors. Great cheese selection!
