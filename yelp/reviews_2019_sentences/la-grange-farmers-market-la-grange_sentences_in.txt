This is a pleasingly robust market...but it is a stretch to call it a farmers market.  I counted only three farm vendors, but their quality and variety are strong enough that you should find top-notch wares to suit almost all needs.

The bread and butter of this market is really specialty foods:  wine; olive oil; cheese; chocolates; eggs; meat, poultry, and fish; loose-leaf tea; jams & jellies; salsa; kettle corn and flavored popcorn; and of course bakeries, bakeries, bakeries.  One specializes in Amish sweets; another in bagels; another in artisanal breads; and another (natch) in dog treats.  A couple of others are more general.

Prepared foods is a little weak, so don't count on eating breakfast or lunch here unless you want tamales, or soups, wraps, or veggie burgers from an outfit called Organic Eating Well.

Oh yeah, and there is a knife sharpener so that you can slice up all of the goodies that you take home.

A weekday morning market is rare, but I sure appreciated discovering this one.  I found easy street parking on the same block as the market.
