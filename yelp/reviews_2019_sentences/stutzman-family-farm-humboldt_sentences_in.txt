Great family farm with delicious bacon.  We have been getting food through farm match and everything has been exceptional and fresh.  I wish they had more produce but other than that I would definitely recommend for healthy chemical-free meats and dairy.  (Delicious Kefir and yogurt) They have a wonderful sauerkraut also.  Very friendly
