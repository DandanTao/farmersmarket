Growing Home offers an excellent CSA box.  I would say their boxes have a high concentration of tomatoes, potatoes and beets.  (Their heirloom tomatoes are great, particularly chocolate tomatoes.  Yes.  Those exist.)  Overall, their veggies are fresh and flavorful.  (Their CSAs don't include fruit.)

There are a lot of CSA boxes available from a lot of farms.  Growing Home has a great business model and gives a lot to the Chicago Community by providing job training among other things.  You can feel great about supporting this farm when you buy your CSA.what's not to love about delicious, organic veggies AND transitional employment for people in areas with limited options?  this place is amazing and always my first stop at the farmer's market.  their egg shares are great as well, but you'll be hooked.  even the "best" eggs from whole foods have nothing on these beauties.
