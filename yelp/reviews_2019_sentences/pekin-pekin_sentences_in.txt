Pekin Farmers' Market will be set up 9-11AM on 7/4/13! The early hours are necessary because of the holiday. On 6/27/13 I bought potatoes from the first digging and some dill from Bob Rollyson, tomatoes from Joyce Frank, and jellies from Montgomery Farms. All excellent stuff! I'll be back to get some popcorn from Progressive Poppers and a salsa mix from Dirt Broke Gourmet. Other than the fourth of July holiday, the market will be 4-6PM every Thursday 'til October.
