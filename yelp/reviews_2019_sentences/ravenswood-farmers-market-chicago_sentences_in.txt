It has taken me years to get here, but I finally made it, and it was well worth the wait. Hosted every Wednesdy 4-8pm thru summer and fall, on the parking lot of Ravenswood Covenant Church, which also runs a daycare on the premise. There are regular weekly vendors, including Hilary's cookies, organic vegetable farmers, a taco/tamale stand, Tamales Express, that sells mangos on sticks, as well as two rotating food trucks. Additional draws are the terrific kids' activities, including a concert, the bouncey house, various activity stations such as baby sensory tents, rock painting, sandbox, water toys, and more. After 6pm the playground opens. We basically love the organizers and have become regulars over the course of this summer/fall. I grew up in Chicago, and lived here a good portion of my life, but finally, have gotten to a point where it feels like I have a neighborhood in Chicago. Can't wait for next year.
