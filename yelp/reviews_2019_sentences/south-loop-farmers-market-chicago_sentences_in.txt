The guy and I stopped by this market and I could not believe how fantastic the prices were! We got there late (around 2:30pm) and they were starting to wrap up, but we managed to pick up a huge box of strawberries (about 12 one pint containers), a huge box of ripe vine tomatoes and a box of green seedless grapes. We had enough fruit for about a month, and we got the whole thing for $20. 

The best part is that this farmer's market is right in front of the new Whole Foods. 

See you next week!I'm gong to go ahead and echo the reviewer below who said this is "barely a farmer's market."
It's more accurately about 8-10 booths set up in a church parking lot, and only half of them have food (produce, baked goods, and the other staples you would expect at a farmer's market).
I was definitely disappointed. I wasn't expecting the same size as Lincoln Park's, but this was a bit pathetic to be frank. I'd save my time if I were you, but if you insist on trying it out, it takes place on Thursdays from 4-8pm.Uhh......this is hardly a "farmers" market. It's mostly people selling a bunch of junk.  There is some fruit and vegetables, but not much.
