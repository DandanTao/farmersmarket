Best place to get free range organic-fed chickens. Pam and Bill take such great pride in raising the chickens, and their organic produce.  It is great to find a farm nearby that cares about the food they grow.I love stopping by here to pick up fresh vegetables and eggs when they are in season. I would give it five stars, except it is a bit pricier than the other cage free eggs and organic produce around.  Still, well worth a trip!My go to place for cage free eggs.  They mainly sell eggs and vegetables (seasonal) from their farm.  There's a gazebo right when you turn onto their property with two coolers inside that contain what's available at the moment with a money drop box.  Its nice to have a nearby place that sells locally-grown perishables.
