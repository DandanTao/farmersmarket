Another year, another Horner Park Farmer's Market. I have loved this particular one for years. So nice to see the community, families, couples, individuals, and many sweet 4 legged beings come together. Small, but packs a punch. Beautiful flowers, great produce, cheeses, meat. Great place.Ridiculously overpriced produce. Small selection. Hit up the Lincoln Square market on Tuesday mornings and Thursday nights instead. Better prices and products.
