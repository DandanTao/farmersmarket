I am not exaggerating when I say that I could count them on one hand- (and I think that 2 of them might have been vendors looking for something to do) Every time I've gone this summer I've been shocked at how unsupported this market feels.,environment,environment,quality,environment
It's like going into a store where I am the only shopper- the help just stares and hovers it's all I can do to keep from bolting out the door.,environment,availability,quality,N/A
I'm not sure why this is the case.,environment,environment,quality,environment
Maybe the move from Friday to Sunday wasn't such a great move (not that Friday packed 'em in either).,environment,environment,environment,environment
Perhaps moving it to Sunday AFTERNOON would be better?,environment,environment,environment,environment
At least then a few downtown stores would be open too.,environment,environment,environment,environment
Add some music or something to give it a more festive buzz?,environment,environment,environment,environment

You will ask yourself how I can write a mostly negative review of one of the best Farmer's Market around and still give it 4 stars.,environment,environment,environment,environment
So I will explain.,environment,environment,Non-relevant,environment
The Downtown Farmer's Market is a outstanding venue and is one of the largest in the nation and probably in the state.,environment,environment,environment,environment
I have been involved with it every since it first started both as a buyer and as a concessioner.,quality,environment,quality,quality
Over the years the market has expanded to extend for many city blocks and attracts vendors from miles around.,environment,environment,environment,environment
The downtown market is not a true Farmer's Market in that it allows non-food vendors as well.,environment,environment,environment,environment

It is a huge and fabulous Saturday event.,environment,environment,environment,environment

The crowding is aggravated by carts and strollers making it difficult for challenged walkers to navigate.,environment,environment,environment,environment
I recommend that seniors try the smaller markets instead.,environment,environment,environment,environment

The organizers still have not learned to ban dog walkers.,environment,environment,environment,environment

"The few people left at this market are very nice and sell great stuff, but with 2-3 stands here in recent times, I really just can't see enough interest if it continues like that.",environment,environment,environment,environment

Glencoe recently started asking citizens to write in suggestions about what they want to see in Glencoe and I suppose at least that's a step in the right direction.,environment,environment,environment,environment

The fact that this Farmers Market - which used to be great - has been allowed to dwindle down to a couple of stands - is another example and it's really unfortunate.,environment,environment,environment,environment
