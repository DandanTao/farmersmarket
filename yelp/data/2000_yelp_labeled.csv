It's small enough to keep busy but not to a point of anxiety.,environment
"It has a great selection of produce, mushrooms and greens especially.",availability
The Michigan Honeycrisp apples are 1) outrageously priced 2) totally worth it.,environment
If all I had was twenty bucks for a week of groceries there's a 100% chance I would spend it all on a dozen of those apples....cos that's all it would get me.,non-relevant
"Moving on, there are a couple vendors selling crepes and breakfast burritos which is a welcomed bonus on a Saturday morning.",non-relevant
AND they have a raffle each month and after each purchase you make you're supplied with a ticket to enter.,non-relevant
I'm a fan.,non-relevant
"Even if you don't need groceries crepes, coffee and a raffle, are you kidding me?",non-relevant
That's a killer way to spend a Saturday morning.,non-relevant
This was one of the few things I liked when I lived in Hyde Park.,non-relevant
Good selection of produce - great apple cider in the fall!,availability
"Also, the crepe guy rocks - the cheese and herb crepe, super yum, for a nice lunch post shopping.",non-relevant
The 61st Street Farmer's Market is a mere toddler in the realm of Chicago's Farmer's Markets.,non-relevant
"In just its second year, this has quickly become one of my favorites though.",non-relevant
"Tucked away in a small section where Woodlawn meets the U of C campus, and therefore my 'hood Hyde Park, it is a location that is meant to be kept fairly small.",environment
"Essentially this market has been placed along 61st, just east of Dorchester.",non-relevant
"It is a very short block and as a result has a small amount of space for stalls- but the organizers of this market (Experimental Station- also located right here) have done a terrific job of ensuring great variety of products and representation in such a small, yet comfortable space.",environment
"This past week, from what I saw, there were: -two different stalls specializing in cheese (funny side story: when a fellow Yelper asked about the differences in the range of blue cheeses being sold- one of them was described as ""tasting like your basement... but in the most delicious way possible!""",quality
"Guess which blue cheese I bought?!?!?) -a farmer who sold free-range chicken eggs (and had the chickens there on display for the children to see) and all cuts of pork raised on her farm -someone selling lamb, goat, and mutton -a very popular crepe stand with a busy man cranking out crepes seemingly through the day -the local bike shop had a space to fix bikes on the spot (I know what I will be doing next Saturday- drop my bike off for an annual ""checkup"" while I shop away) -a stall with fresh herbs, greens and other vegetables (still early in the season for a lot of variety at this point) -another stall selling veg -two different stalls selling their own salsas, sauces, and salad dressings -a community organizer spreading the word about the upcoming ""Real Men Can Cook"" event",availability
"I am sure I am forgetting at least a couple of things- but the point is, there is a great amount of variety.",availability
"They accept LINK, WIC, and food stamps- making it a market for everyone to enjoy!",non-relevant
"They are supposedly working on getting a POS credit card terminal too, which would be awesome.",non-relevant
"While you are there, might as well stop in to Backstory Cafe- a really nice coffee shop which is a part of Experimental Station and open for anyone to attend during the market.",non-relevant
"Just north there is a community garden center filled with all sorts of gorgeous flowers, produce, and the occasional garter snake.",non-relevant
Extremely easy to get to (just off of LSD near the Museum of Science and Industry) with unlimited street parking and tucked away in a really lovely part of town- with a lot to do and see after.,environment
"I suggest everyone give it a try at least once this summer- besides, it is one of the few farmer's markets that is actually on a Saturday in the city.",non-relevant
"I know I'm northern California spoiled, but I found pretty slim-pickings.",non-relevant
"Will give it another try, though.",non-relevant
I really love this market.,non-relevant

They accept LINK and will double it up to $25 which is great for a neighborhood in a food desert.,environment

Love it.,non-relevant
Want some more of it.,non-relevant
Alas the City Farmer's Markets are bustling with local Farmer's fresh produce!!,non-relevant
When they First opened this Spring it was more food trucks and tents from nearby restaurants selling quick grab and go lunches or treats.,non-relevant
Which in of itself is fine except when you really look forward to what the name implies - a Farmer's Market! (Hence the 4 of 5 star rating) There's really nothing better than supporting the local Farmer's and bringing home farm to table produce knowing they are all pesticide free and the money goes right back to them growing beautiful produce Season after Season!!,quality
Just take the grocery shopping off your errands since they are open from May to October because just about anything you could ever want is found here in beautiful abundance and much less costly then the stores plus you actually get to meet the dedicated Farmer's and their families.,non-relevant
So darn cute!,environment
"Of course everything is seasonal and so what you find may varry but on my most recent visit, I brought home a basket of blueberries, another of cherries and some strawberries, juicy peaches, kale, sweet corn, vine ripe tomatoes, fresh basil and mint, cucumbers, zucchini, eggplant, sweet onions, raw apiary honey and a fresh bouquet of flowers all for under $40!!",availability
Tip: Go a little early and scout out the Perfectly Imperfect boxes... these treasures are slightly blemished but otherwise perfect and a generous box will only run you $5.,non-relevant

The same vendors are there every week and I enjoy the atmosphere.,non-relevant
"The prices, in my opinion, are slightly higher compared to a grocery store but you get to buy from local farms.",environment
"My favorite places are the Amish bakeries (they have donuts, bread, pies, etc) and the mushroom farm (vegan tamales, ravioli, veggie burgers).",environment
Beware!,non-relevant
"I bought a head of broccoli at one of the vendors and there were small, green caterpillars.",environment
I didn't notice them until I went home.,non-relevant
There are ways to get ride of them but I stopped buying broccoli out of fear of finding those little critters.,non-relevant
Just make sure to check your vegetables before buying.,quality

"Tons of foot traffic weaving underneath the Chicago Picasso from businesses men/women, tourists, students, and seniors all looking for the same thing: to eat and buy good ingredients.",non-relevant
"Dozens of little stalls showcasing aromatic baked goods, fresh home-grown vegetables, beekeepers from Indiana, bamboo tabletop decorations, fragrant floral pieces, even fig trees - a culturally abuzz square framed by the tall skyscrapers and under the shadow of Picasso.",availability
"Yes, even if you aren't coming to buy anything, then come for the vivid colors and rush of life you'll experience here (can you tell, these kinds of things inspire me?)",non-relevant
"A huge shoutout to my friends at Kress Apiary for keeping the bees alive, please do buy their unfiltered, raw, honey (which keeps bits of honeycomb, antioxidants, and nutrients that other honey companies filter out) Smaller farmers market with a great location weekdays in the heart of the loop.",non-relevant
It's fun to escape the office and walk around to sample the different foods (I always snag a taste of the tofu samples).,environment
"As with a lot of the farmers market, it's pretty much the same vendors that are at all the other farmers markets around the city.",environment
"But, as it gets later in the season, there's a lot more produce at a bit more reasonable prices.",environment
"There's also lots of bakery vendors, some restaurant stands (where you can get lunch food like sandwiches or pad Thai), and flower/plant stands.",environment
When I use to live only a few blocks from Daley Plaza I would venture to this farmer market every so often but I never found much I care to buy.,availability
It's nice to have a farmers market right in the loop but outside that novelty I've been to much better farmers market and as a local or tourist I just tend to breeze right through it.,non-relevant
"I recently moved to River West, and this Thursday market is the one closest to me.",non-relevant
"It's not as crowded as a lot of other markets, so you can get the personal attention they lack.",environment
One of the vendors here actually took the time to explain the difference between a leek and a large green onion.,non-relevant
(Leeks are milder and better for saut_ing and don't get as slimy.),non-relevant
My favorite bakery booth is the Amish one.,non-relevant
"I'm not sure if these women are really Amish, or if they're just actors dressed up to look Amish (hey...",non-relevant
I've seen Witness).,non-relevant
But I'm leaning toward authentic because they don't pluck their eyebrows.,non-relevant
The Amish purple wheat bread with nuts is delish.,non-relevant
"But if you don't buy it before lunchtime, they usually run out.",non-relevant
The best produce is in the booth in the photo below.,quality
"They have the best quality tomatoes, leeks and even golden beats... even my Whole Foods didn't have golden beets this summer.",availability

Magical.,non-relevant
The Farmer's market transforms the usually hectic city corner into a blissful bazaar.,non-relevant
On a nice day it's pretty hard to convince yourself to go back to work.,non-relevant

Everything is so reasonably priced.,environment
You'll pay more at Whole Foods for practically everything at the market.,availability
The vendors are nice and everything is fresh.,quality
There is something for everyone.,availability
From fresh flowers to homemade cakes and candy or even just a quick getaway from the office!,availability

See what other culture means.,non-relevant
Listen to good music.,environment
Even dance.,non-relevant
See u there :) P This is the best farmers market in Chicago for several reasons:,non-relevant
"It offers the cheapest produce in the city - tomatoes for $2/lb instead of $4 or even $5 in the neighborhood markets (There's a specific vendor from the Indianapolis area that has the best tomato selection around), inexpensive flowers, great selection of produce throughout the season at very reasonable prices.",availability
It's conveniently located steps away from the Washington blue line stop.,non-relevant
There are places to sit.,non-relevant
"It begins before 9 a.m., unlike certain neighborhood markets (I'm looking at you, Logan Square...what kinda start time is 10 a.m.?!)",non-relevant
"It's downtown, close to Michigan Ave and State Street shopping.",non-relevant
ENJOY!,non-relevant
Go get some tomatoes from the Indianapolis fellas!,availability
"I've been to Daley Plaza's FM about 8-10 times over the many years and overall it's ok but a Farmers Market, it really isn't.",non-relevant
"It's more of a collection of specialty items that, while intriguing and somewhat unique, don't really rep a FM, apart from logistics.",availability
"If you're looking for tons of fresh fruits, veggies and produce, well, you might want to look elsewhere.",availability
These are the items i look for when going to a place like this.,availability
"As a side, when going to the (WI) Brunkow Cheese booth, I inquired about their awesome product in a few of Chicago's notable restaurants to which they responded in utter confusion with a side of attitude.lol.",non-relevant
"Hey Brunkow, if you're being featured in restaurants by your namesake, you might want to have the ppl representing your product/company have a basic understanding of where you are being served.",non-relevant
Just sayin.,non-relevant
I pass by they have like Google festival and computer science Also see ppl setting having their lunch on the areas w/tables and chairs then the fountain is very relaxing I made a mistake in ordering a shrimp sandwich from Amazing Shrimp the other day.,non-relevant
"I've never thought of Hammond, IN as shrimp experts, or shrimp anything, but I figured, maybe they're transplants from a place where they do know shrimp.",non-relevant
"Anyways, all I can say is UGH!",non-relevant
Nothing is much worse than feeling gross for the remainder of the day.,non-relevant
"The guy behind the tent thankfully dropped the garlic salt housed in a glass container, right before my order, or I would have been treated to a salt bath with what was termed a shrimp sandwich.",non-relevant
The sammy was all about a huge brioche roll.,non-relevant
"After that fluffy/puffy 2 inch high, 3 inches wide piece of shiny bread, I couldn't tell you much about the shrimp, as I couldn't taste it and only saw 1 chopped up and swimming in a mayo and cabbage sea.",non-relevant
There was seriously A LOT of mayo - i tons of dripping mayo and messy cabbage hanging over the bread.,non-relevant
It was more like a slaw sandwich with a medium sized shrimp as an afterthought.,non-relevant
"For $13.00, that was about the biggest rip off the market has to offer.",non-relevant
"Now, Brunkow Cheese of WI is the antithesis of the shrimp sammy.",non-relevant
Everything from the aroma to the taste to the price was so perfect.,quality
Absolutely wonderful cheese!!!! 5 stars for the Brunkow family of cheese.,quality
"A few weeks ago, the best asparagus for a buck a bunch were here.",quality
"They were thin and green and delicious - so good, they were tasty raw.",quality
"Not to forget, a huge bargain!!",non-relevant
Prices for cherries are high - or higher than Organic cherries delivered to my door...so I thought that was a bit odd for non-organics to be higher than organic.,quality
They looked tasty for the cherry devotees like me.,quality
There's a guy that makes AMAZING cakes and has samples out to tempt customers even further.,environment
If there were more than 2 of us to devour a cake I would buy one in a heartbeat.,non-relevant
"Every flavor I've tried is decadent, flavorful, delicious and so moist.",quality
Great time at this farmers market!!!!,non-relevant
"The variety is unbelievable, something for everyone.",availability
If you're in the city when the market is happening stop by!!!!!,non-relevant
This is a great place to get lunch if you are downtown.,environment
"The prices are equal to or less than what you would pay in a restaurant and you can be assured of organic, non-gmo fare.",quality
I love Gayle's cheese sandwiches but they also have the longest line.,non-relevant
"However, just down from Gayle's is a tamale shop on the southwest corner that serves organic vegan tamales 2 for $5 that are to die for!",quality
This particular market seems to lean more towards prepared foods for consumption probably because there is such a huge supply of rabid lunch fanatics.,non-relevant
"However there is an ample selection of organic vegetables, meat, fruits, and normal farmers market-type items for sale.",availability
This market runs from mid-May to the end of October and is famous as the longest running farmers market in Chicago.,non-relevant
The hours from 7 AM to 3 but many of the stalls stay open later so you can stop and pick something up for the ride home if you're lucky.,non-relevant
Another great part of this great city is the various farmers markets.,environment
I was able to stop at this market and check things out.,non-relevant
"Due to the location which is right outside of the Daley Plaza so you can pick up vegetables, fruits or flowers when you are leaving the courts, heading to work or during your lunch break.",availability
The market starts in the morning and ends early afternoon.,non-relevant
The prices are okay for location.,environment
Great people watching.,environment
Go and enjoy this market.,non-relevant
What an adorable little market!,environment
"They have pretty much everything you would expect (fresh pasta, plants, vegetables, dog treats, etc.) right in the middle of the loop.",availability

Passed this twice before actually stopping to check it out.,non-relevant
"Kinda lame in May, though...",non-relevant
"Great people, great corn.",environment
"Freshest produce around,and their children are polite and darn good looking too.",quality
The corn on the cob was so sweet and delicious our family of four polished off a bag of 15 cobs in one sitting!,quality
So yummy. 15 cobs for $4.99.,quality
"We also bought a very good, sweet and juicy watermelon.",quality
We spent only ten dollars our first trip there.,non-relevant
We will be hitting this farm stand again VERY soon!,non-relevant
Love this place!,non-relevant
The corn on the cob is my absolute favorite!,non-relevant
I find myself frequenting Brandau's multiple times a week during the summer.,non-relevant
All of the produce is fresh and tasty.,quality
This place has THE BEST Michigan peaches you will ever taste.,quality
It's family owned and the guys there couldn't be nicer.,environment
"Visiting the Glen Ellyn French Market was a bit of a surprise, since my family and I are used to the bustling Saturday market in Wheaton.",non-relevant
"From what I gather, this market is newer, maybe still getting rolling.",non-relevant
"It happens on Sundays, from 9am to 2pm, in the parking lot at the corner of Crescent Blvd and Glenwood Ave.",environment
It's expected to continue until the end of October.,non-relevant
"On our visit here, there were a couple farms selling produce, several bakeries, stands selling granola, tea, iced coffee, sausage and cheeses.",availability
A lady was selling Usbourne books (love those!).,non-relevant
Hmm what am I missing?,non-relevant
"Oh yea, two guys were making the most delicious chicken tacos.",quality
The amount of vendors and the crowd size are definitely more manageable than the Saturday market in Wheaton.,environment
"I didn't care for the iced coffee I tried, which had me missing my Saturday cup from I Have A Bean.",non-relevant
"I'd skip that next time, but the rest of the market is worth checking out.",non-relevant
"If you see the guys grilling chicken, you must try a taco!",non-relevant
I've just returned from a shopping trip to the Glen Ellyn French Market.,non-relevant
I arrived at about 12:30 on a spectacularly beautiful fall day.,non-relevant
"Despite it being close to closing time, every vendor's booth was well stocked.",non-relevant
"Not a lot of vendors compared to Wheaton and even little Warrenville, but there is a decent choice of ""farmers"", meat purveyors, bakers, and random sellers of jewelry and olive oil.",availability
"That said, the biggest negative is the lack of shoppers.",non-relevant
I am not exaggerating when I say that I could count them on one hand- (and I think that 2 of them might have been vendors looking for something to do) Every time I've gone this summer I've been shocked at how unsupported this market feels.,non-relevant
It's like going into a store where I am the only shopper- the help just stares and hovers it's all I can do to keep from bolting out the door.,non-relevant
I'm not sure why this is the case.,non-relevant
Maybe the move from Friday to Sunday wasn't such a great move (not that Friday packed 'em in either).,non-relevant
Perhaps moving it to Sunday AFTERNOON would be better?,non-relevant
At least then a few downtown stores would be open too.,non-relevant
Add some music or something to give it a more festive buzz?,environment
Right now it feels awkward and just plain dead.,non-relevant
"I am moving from Cedar Rapids, and you have absolutely no idea how much I am going to miss the Downtown Farmers Market.",non-relevant
I love walking around downtown in the blocked off areas and shopping.,non-relevant
There is such an amazing variety of things to purchase!,availability
"Lawn ornaments, food, kettle corn (mmmm), jewelry, cutting boards, plants, produce, breakfast burritos, you name it.",availability
"I had my favorite vendors that I always hit up, but I loved going to every shop and checking out what is new.",non-relevant
"It's a great place to take visiting friends and family, and it is friendly for all tastes of style and food.",environment
Everyone we ever took there fell in love just as much as I did.,non-relevant
I will definitely be driving back a few weekends this summer to attend!,non-relevant
I love it!,non-relevant
The night market was fun but busy...,environment
I'm sure the next one will be more organized to handle the crowd.,environment
"First off, lets call it what it is people, it's a french market, not a farmers market.",non-relevant
"Supposedly one of the largest 'farmers' markets in the Midwest, and I'd believe it.",non-relevant
"At least 8 blocks of produce, meat, baked goods, jewelry, crafts, and street food vendors.",availability
I didn't check *every* produce vendor but the ones I did notice were all from Iowa.,non-relevant
I wish I had a cooler big enough to bring some organic free range chickens raised in Iowa all the way home to Chicago.,quality
It's a pity this market is only every other weekend.,non-relevant
By 8:30 the streets were packed and a few vendors were running out of green beans and cherries already.,availability
Only open till noon so get up early and wander around downtown Cedar Rapids before all the good stuff is gone!,non-relevant
This is a pretty good Farmers Market.,environment
It's definitely the largest in the area.,environment
They have nearly everything you could want and some of the vendors even take EBT.,availability
Parking is always an issue when you have such a gigantic event.,environment
No problem - I just ride the bicycle down there.,non-relevant
It's more convenient and also lets me limit the amount of things purchased.,environment
"Being a minimalist who lives in a van (by choice), I can tell you this is a ""grazer's"" paradise!",non-relevant
There are lots of samples - enough for a free meal.,availability
The only thing I really don't like is that dogs are permitted in the farmer's market.,environment
I think this poses a health and safety concern.,safety
It's only a matter of time until something happens - a child is bitten or there is a dog fight or I step in dog sh** ....,safety
About a month ago I saw a large dog lean forward and lick a cucumber sitting near the edge of a table.,safety
Gross!,safety
The other thing that bothers me has been mentioned before: One week the event is in the downtown area.,non-relevant
The other week it is much smaller and located near 8th Avenue.,environment
I wish we could have it one way or the other.,non-relevant
A couple of times I've gone to the larger downtown site hoping for something only to find the smaller market was being held a few blocks away.,environment
"For the dog issue and the inconvenience of not having the market in the same place each week, I'm going to deduct two stars.",environment
I've witnessed several incidents with dogs and don't feel comfortable with them being permitted in here.,environment
Mark my words - it's only time till something bad happens.,non-relevant
"If I get bitten, the owner is getting sued as well as the city for its negligence.",non-relevant
"Other than those minor little things, I think this is a decent event and am glad we have it in Cedar Rapids.",environment
It shows what can be accomplished when we all support a great idea..,non-relevant
You will ask yourself how I can write a mostly negative review of one of the best Farmer's Market around and still give it 4 stars.,non-relevant
So I will explain.,non-relevant
The Downtown Farmer's Market is a outstanding venue and is one of the largest in the nation and probably in the state.,environment
I have been involved with it every since it first started both as a buyer and as a concessioner.,non-relevant
Over the years the market has expanded to extend for many city blocks and attracts vendors from miles around.,non-relevant
The downtown market is not a true Farmer's Market in that it allows non-food vendors as well.,non-relevant
"You will see people selling everything from jewelry to candles food sellers from local restaurants, wine, clothing, local charities, entertainers, and so on.",availability
Among all the vendors are actual produce sellers.,non-relevant
A list of most vendors can be found on the Downtown Market website.,non-relevant
It is a huge and fabulous Saturday event.,non-relevant
And yet I prefer to skip it in favor of other Farmer's Markets which are smaller and more produce oriented for the following reasons.,non-relevant
It is VERY crowded.,environment
"Attendance is high (easily topping 16,000 per Saturday morning) and the jostling and shoving can be overwhelming at times.",non-relevant
You will find a lot to purchase but you will leave exhausted.,non-relevant
It has become so big that you will find it difficult to find the vendors you really want to buy from among the 220 + vendors.,environment
We are talking about 11 streets here and no printed map to guide you.,non-relevant
The crowding is aggravated by carts and strollers making it difficult for challenged walkers to navigate.,environment
I recommend that seniors try the smaller markets instead.,environment
The organizers still have not learned to ban dog walkers.,environment
"You will have to dodge leases, the infrequent dog fight, and other canine problems.",environment
Just think a minute.,non-relevant
What would you think if you saw people walking the aisles of the local supermarket with a dog?,environment
What we have in the Cedar Rapids Downtown Market is a great market that has gotten a bit too big and needs to be trimmed down.,environment
"I am a long-time fan of Farmer's Markets and have attended them for many years, long before the downtown market even existed, but my preference is for the smaller markets, which I visit once a week religiously.",non-relevant
The downtown market is only an occasional thing.,non-relevant
A great place to spend a summer Saturday morning.,non-relevant
"There are over 200 vendors ranging from prepared food, wine, candles, crafts and jewelry and even...produce!",availability
The downtown farmers market attracts thousands of people (and hundreds of pets) at each event on the first and third Saturday from June to thru Sept.,non-relevant
"Open from 7:30 to noon, you'll need to come early to get some of the most popular items.",non-relevant
The downtown CR farmers market is never a disappointment!,non-relevant
Roll out of bed and start your Saturday morning right.,non-relevant
They have plenty of options for a quick breakfast while browsing the market.,non-relevant
I love love love the jewelry offered-picked up some of the cutest earrings for cheap!,non-relevant
The market has quite a few wine vendors that are great.,environment
You cannot beat the prices of fruits and veggies here.,environment
"Don't miss out on the live music, juggling acts, and break dancing, either!",environment
"I love, love, love the Farmer's Market in Downtown Cedar Rapids.",non-relevant
It is ginourmous and the variety of vendors is really great.,availability
I come for the fresh produce but stay for the food vendors!!,quality
Had a chicken gyro from the Aladdin stand and it was an awesome breakfast.,quality
"I looked for the famous Victor's breakfast burrito stand, but they were no where to be found.",non-relevant
Not that there arn't a plethora of awesome vendors to choose from!,availability
"Seriously, come with an appetite.",non-relevant
You won't be dissapointed.,non-relevant
"I love all of the fresh flowers, the huge gardening pots and plants at ridic prices, the fresh breads, handmade jewelry, metal work, and of course the fresh produce.",availability
"It gets seriously crowded though, so be prepared/patient and enjoy.",environment
"Some places do accept checks and credit, but I play it safe and bring cash.",environment
I look forward to going every Saturday they have it!,non-relevant
We moved here just in time to catch the last one of the summer and I must say I was blown away.,non-relevant
"I think I had low expectations coming from California with all the farmer's markets there, but downtown Cedar Rapids farmer's market was amazing.",non-relevant
"Meat vendors, wine vendors, so much great produce, and tons of homemade foodstuffs.",availability
"We got BBQ sauces, cupcakes, cheese....so much tastiness.",quality
I can't wait until it starts again and will definitely bring more bags next time.,non-relevant
The farmer's markets downtown are one of my favorite ways to spend a Saturday morning.,non-relevant
"You can find a wide variety of items (of course FOOD, jewelry, flowers, home items, clothing, books) and entertainment (magic shows, juggling, music, theater previews, and a junk band, children's play areas).",availability
You can really spend as much or as little money and time as you want.,non-relevant
I only wish they would start doing it every Saturday instead of biweekly.,non-relevant
"If you haven't been yet, it is definitely worth waking up for!",non-relevant
"I just got back from Mexico so it was nice to hear people speaking in English, and not see trash everywhere!",non-relevant
It was nice to get out and walk around!,non-relevant
Downtown Cedar Rapids is a nice and clean area with great people and great local business's!,environment
"I picked up a few things for the homestead one of the cooler things I think that I got today was an ANT that was made of three rocks and some metal welded around it with washers as the eyes! (RS Randy Schnebbe Welding Studio) Victor, Ia.",non-relevant
I also found someone to buy great tasting Lefse from!,quality
"Dale Surh Free-range Chickens, Lefse and Kringla.",quality
"Calmar, Ia.",non-relevant
In a word (customized word art) it's a little expensive and you could easily do it yourself but I bought a Chicago sign for $56.,environment

There's a lot to see and several rows of it.,non-relevant
It has a nice location by the train station and steps from Downtown Wheaton.,environment
One thing that I noticed after the fact when I had already been through the market is that they are not dog friendly.,environment
My dog was walking all throughout the market with no problem.,non-relevant
"Than at the end, I see the small sign that says no dogs allowed.",environment
I don't understand how that could be the case when this is outside.,non-relevant
"Either way, no one stopped us with him walking around and it was fine.",non-relevant
"Another thing is that there really aren't that many food vendors as I thought that would be. there was a popcorn vendor, a bakery, some coffee, and maybe about 2 or 3 more food vendors.",availability
"There was not much selection, so if you are hungry just keep that in mind and check out something in downtown Wheaton.",availability
I'm taking one star off simply because it gets PACKED!,quality
As in you can't move while attempting to walk through the aisles.,environment
"And then people bring their kids, strollers, and dogs, and you think all hell is about to break loose.",environment
The assortment of vendors is great though.,availability
"Flowers, produce, meats, bakery, coffee, jewelry, skincare, etc.",availability

Go here in the middle and the parking lot on Willow is really backed up and precarious.,environment
"Totally crowded at 10:30AM, can't even move.",environment
Now here's where my complaining really begins:,non-relevant
"I know it's a ""French market"" and not a ""farmers' market"" but the fact that this place is 9-10x more jewelry and pastries than produce is ridiculous.",non-relevant
"That's kind of depressing, and the little bit of farmer's stands is not super great either.",environment
"Out of this whole place, only one is organic produce.",quality
Just one stand.,non-relevant
And they sell out of stuff QUICK.,non-relevant
The other places have been mostly disappointing.,environment
"Instead of growing and selling spring crops locally in the spring, they'd rather sell summer crops from Florida.",non-relevant
And they all had these southern Illinois strawberries that were all bruised and looked like they were going bad.,quality
It seems like they all got them from the same distributor/farm or whatever.,non-relevant
They aren't selling things they grow for the most part.,quality
The one nice thing I got was some Michigan hydroponic tomatoes that were very fresh and broccoli.,quality
"Let's hope they taste as good as they look, and let's hope the southern Illinois strawberries (which I got out of curiosity) taste a whole lot better than they look.",quality
I thought local food was supposed to be fresher than grocery store food?,quality
Not always.,non-relevant

"But by the time we left, it was getting crowded and the strollers had made their way to the aisles.",environment
"So yes, come early.",non-relevant
I started making purchases almost immediately.,non-relevant
I think that may have been a mistake.,non-relevant
Similar vendors had similar products at a lower cost as I moved up and down the aisles.,non-relevant
"If you have the time, I would encourage you to look at everything and then make your decisions.",non-relevant
But if there's a limited supply of things - get it while the getting is good!,availability
Let's talk about some of my favorites...,non-relevant
We tried some honey.,non-relevant
It was marvelous!,non-relevant

I tried tea from two different vendors.,non-relevant
"Both were good, but I preferred The Tea House.",non-relevant
The gentleman working that booth really knew his stuff and I was sold on the Tea-Vine without even tasting it.,non-relevant
I've since tasted it and it's exactly as he described.,quality
Nice!,non-relevant
"There were at least two meat vendors, but I was wooed by Farm Fresh Foodstuffs.",non-relevant

He had a lot to say and I ended up a big fan after a few minutes of chatting.,non-relevant

"Although, I did hear they were asked by multiple people, so it may make its way into their French Market inventory in the future.",non-relevant
You never know...,non-relevant
What they did provide were fresh baked pretzel rolls and still warm donuts.,availability
"No, not warm from the sun...but warm from the onsite fryer.",non-relevant
They're making that magic happen on the premises.,non-relevant
It was a perfect way to wrap up a delicious morning at the market!,non-relevant

"Here you'll find fresh crepes, beautiful flowers, fruit and vegetables, handcrafted soaps, jewelry, knick knacks, it has it all.",availability

My top pic for jewelry here is Adorn512.,non-relevant
Such a delicate and unique but trendy selection.,availability
About the crowds though.,environment
I'd recommend either coming early to avoid them and have first pick of the best produce.,non-relevant
I love spending my Saturday mornings walking around Farmer's Markets.,non-relevant
I've been to the Wheaton French Market three times already since moving to Wheaton.,non-relevant
The vendor offerings are pretty good and I always find myself leaving with at least a few goodies.,availability
"You can find expect to find macarons, coffee, pastries, bread, olives, pickles, dog treats, jewelry, gluten-free goodies and don't forget about the fruits and veggies.",availability
The good: -You're supporting small business owners and farmers -It's a good way to discover new products or items you haven't tried before -All your favorite Wheaton businesses are in one convenient location -Lots of vendors take both cash and cards!,environment
Huge pro,non-relevant
The meh: -No dogs allowed.,environment
"Although my dogs aren't well behaved enough to visit such an event, I always love meeting other dog owners and seeing the pups around. -The space itself is incredibly narrow-- which probably has a lot to do with why no dogs are allowed. -Parking is tough unless you get here right when it starts or a little before.",environment
You might find yourself driving in circles for parking for awhile.,environment
I was here at 745 one morning and had my share of parking spots.,environment
The bad: -No real cons that would keep me from coming,environment
I'll continue coming to The French Market as long as the weather and my work schedule allows.,non-relevant
It's a great way to spend a relaxing Saturday morning.,non-relevant

This market has a variety of things!,availability
"From fresh veggies, fresh fruit, fresh crepes, fresh coffee, fresh smiles!",availability
Just a lovely place to be on a Saturday morning.,non-relevant
Plenty of seating and people are so pleasant.,non-relevant
Maybe this market has declined since the previous reviews.,non-relevant
It is messy.,safety
"The vendors are crammed into, too small of an area making it uncomfortable to navigate THEM AND the patrons who feel it necessary to bring strollers or walking dogs.",environment
"I LIKE kids and dogs, but the little ones get bags in their faces, trip people up and see only butts and legs (and dogs).",environment
Both are safety hazards.,safety
There are also too few garbage bins and it is common to see used toothpicks from samples littering the food product tables.,environment
"This market has 3 notable vendors, cheese pretzel/bread and knife sharpener.",availability
All others are price-gougers and slopping messers!,availability
A wonderful and pretty large farmer's market.,environment
"Great choice of local and seasonal veggies, fruits, cheese, pastries, breads, coffee, tea, crepes, jams, jellies, mustards, jewelry, accessories, etc.",availability
There was even a little live music.,environment
"The only downfall was that there was only 1 booth containing any meat or eggs, and by 10:30am the eggs were sold out.",non-relevant
I purposely wear a scarf whenever i come here to get the true FRENCH market experience.,non-relevant
Just kidding.,non-relevant
(No I'm not).,non-relevant

This is one of the best markets in the Illinois suburbs. 4 rows of local arts and crafts and also baked goods and produce.,non-relevant
Love the fall season especially because of the squashes.,non-relevant
My favorite so far are acorn and butternut.,non-relevant

My Saturday mornings have been spent here for the past 2 weeks.,non-relevant
My advice: stop by the vendors with the baked goodies.,non-relevant

"OMG, YES!), a grilled cheese shop, and others I can't possibly remember.",non-relevant
"The earlier you get there the better as there is a lot to see but it's all crammed in a very small area - and once those mommies wielding their double-wide ankle destroyers, um, I mean, strollers, get out & about, it's a bit cramped.",environment
"I wish it was adjacent to a park so you could take a break from the crowd and sit down to enjoy your lunch, breakfast or snack you will inevitably buy while there.",environment
At least there is parking garage next door so parking is a breeze!,environment
The local farmer's market is my go to place for my local honey.,environment
"This farmers market is really great, however, it can be difficult to navigate with the crowds while finding a place to park.",environment
For parking and convenience I usually opt for parking in the parking garage just south of the train tracks.,environment
While at the market the are two main aisles that have vendors of all kinds.,non-relevant
"You can find anything from tea, to homemade dog treats, to flowers for your garden, there are even a couple of food truck/vendors.",availability
"And if you are fortunate to walk the aisles during the month of May, the fragrance from the lilac bushes located between the farmers market and the train tracks waft thought the aisles, it's truly a great experience.",non-relevant
"Cool concept, very poor experience though.",environment
As others have stated this market has wonderful variety.,availability
Tons of vendors and many types of goodies to buy.,availability
But...get ready for my rant...,non-relevant
People I have a dog that I adore and we take him lots of place with us but I make sure it's an appropriate place like a park.,environment
Why a bunch of you think it's cute to bring Fido with you to an over crowded outdoor market with very cramped quarters makes no sense to me.,environment
I loved the lady with two dogs trying to navigate the super narrow aisles.,environment
"Next, leave the damn stroller at home!!!!",non-relevant
"If your precious child cannot walk on their own, than don't come or leave the baby home with dad or mom.",non-relevant
Seriously!,non-relevant

"I have not yet tried the strawberry banana bread, sounds like it will make a great lunch.",availability
Stop and take a look around.,non-relevant
It really is one of the better local farmers markets.,non-relevant
"The Wheaton French Market is a good place to go if you're looking for a variety of food, not all of it French.",availability
I suppose the most French thing about this market is the crepe stand the crepes there are freshly made and taste fantastic.,quality
"There's a *lot* of bread as well, and there are some nuns sell both savory and sweet bread.",non-relevant
Vegetables and fruit can be hit or miss.,non-relevant
"If it's out of season in the midwest, expect the fruit you find to be trucked up from Florida.",non-relevant
"Nothing wrong with that, and the peaches *were* good... but next time I'll wait the extra month.",quality
"It's conveniently located in downtown Wheaton and there's always a bustle of activity, live music, many pounds of frozen blueberries (which we did get one year they were very good)... in generally, this is what I would expect a farmers' market to be.",non-relevant
I would consider myself a farmer's market junkie.,non-relevant
Today we missed Naperville's due to yoga so we ventured out to Wheaton which is open till 2pm.,non-relevant
Long and short of it: we won't be back.,non-relevant
1: the aisles.,non-relevant
Everyone has done a great job punting out they are too narrow.,non-relevant
It's horrid!,non-relevant
We aren't in Paris!,non-relevant
Spread it out a little more.,non-relevant
"2: the non-food vendors: while I understand this is a French Market, the numerous vendors peddling various other goods just cramps up the area.",non-relevant
We only came for food!,non-relevant
"3: the ""grocery"" produce: perhaps my biggest irk.",quality
"We go to farmers markets to buy local, supporting the local farmers, to eat in the season and get the freshest, whole foods we can.",non-relevant
How in the world are tomatoes from Arizona(as it said on the box) fit in that?,non-relevant
Some purveyors had so any different varieties of produce that it was obvious that they are not growing them but purchasing them at wholesale and turning a profit on people none the wiser.,availability
Talk to the vendors people!,non-relevant
"I found a certified organic farm from Michigan that was able to fulfill my need for cucumbers, tomatoes and kale but some of you may of bought the same stuff being sold at Mariano's down the street!",availability
A few reviewers said that the food was more expensive than the grocery store.,non-relevant
It can be.,non-relevant
"But we pay more to support the local farmers and sometimes it's a better deal than the chemically enhanced, grown in a lab, cross bred stuff found at the grocery store.",environment
You pay a premium to eat good the way it looks grown from a seed with little to no human intervention!!,non-relevant
In the end we won't come back.,non-relevant
There are so many farmers markets now and this one for the reasons above is just not worth the time.,non-relevant
Hmmmm...,non-relevant
"Parking is rough, the crowds are absurd, and I can't say the selection is any more amazing than I can get in Naperville.",environment
I'm glad I went but I don't think I'll go back anytime soon.,non-relevant
"This is a great farmers market with a large selection of produce from several vendors, as well as some meat and dairy, and non-food items like bird seed and gift items.",availability
It can get crowded and the location doesn't have a lot of great parking nearby - but the selection and prices are worth it.,environment
"Whatever you do, if you bring your dog, look out for idiots who don't watch their dogs and use retractable leashes.",environment
Some stupid polish chick and her idiot boyfriend on Sunday had a little rat looking dog that they let come over by my dog and tangle the leash all up and of course my dog was annoyed and growled at their stupid dog and they blamed me.,environment
Be aware.....I will not be taking my nice dog there anymore because of stupid dog owners.,environment
"While I was in town a couple weeks ago, my parents invited us to tag along with them on a Sunday morning trip to the Lions Farmer's Market.",non-relevant
"The market wasn't really around (or it was small) while I lived in town years ago, so I was pretty shocked to find out how large and diverse it was (I also commend my parents for shopping here).",environment
The entire [long] parking lot of the train station is occupied for this market -- with a good crowd of people and dogs.,environment
"It's bigger than the Schaumburg Farmer's Market, which is usually my favorite in the 'burbs. All your food bases are covered: veggies (soooo many delicious veggies at different booths), breads, sauces, fruits, meat, eggs, etc.",availability
"Several craft booths were present, including one with stunning dried & decorated gourds.",non-relevant
It fascinated me.,non-relevant
"At one end of the market was a taco booth, with fresh tacos for people to enjoy while they look around.",non-relevant

"While their location is idea for visibility, it is not ideal for parking.",environment
"We only had to walk a block from where we parked, which isn't bad, but having to cross the railroad tracks can be a bit tricky for the elderly crowd (one, they are trying to hurry, which always makes me nervous, and two, they have to keep looking down to make sure they walk over the tracks so they can't keep looking up to see where they are actually going...I'm just glad I was there to hold Busia's arm & direct her while she looked down to watch her step).",environment
"When I saw that I couldn't check in at the Farmer's Market because it wasn't on Yelp yet, I was shocked!",non-relevant
"This busy farmer's market appeared to have numerous satisfied customers, a regular clientele, and tons of great produce.",environment
"From the standard organic veggies you expect to see at a farmer's market to harder to find market goods like Farmer Nick's naturally-raised meats and free-range chicken eggs, you can get most of your fresh food shopping done here on Sundays between 8am and 1pm from June to October.",availability
"Everything is seasonal, so I say ""most"" because if you're like me, you want a couple of bananas every week to put in your Cheerios.",non-relevant
"Beyond that, though, this market has such excellent variety that you can plan any number of meals without leaving this block-long stretch of stands.",availability
"I snapped up some sweet corn, brussels sprouts, and apples after waffling over whether to take home the season's last strawberries.",availability
"There are also a few unexpected things, like the guy sharpening knives on an old-school wheel (I love when markets have this!), the smoothie stand, the pizza-while-you-shop guys, and the fresh hummus stall, which has at least a dozen kinds of hummus plus packed olives and cornichons.",non-relevant
You can even buy pastries from nuns.,availability
There were a couple of vendors that caused me to raise an eyebrow.,non-relevant
"I expect to see marble wine bottle toppers at WineStyles, not at a farmer's market.",non-relevant
"I would have liked to see something more fitting with the idea of local, sustainable products there instead, like Chicago rooftop honey.",quality
"The Lion's Club sponsors the market, and they are always accepting donations of used glasses, plus they accept used ink cartridges for recycling.",non-relevant
"They also have themed market days from time to time, like the Fitness Fair and French Market Sunday.",non-relevant
"Overall, this is a great Farmer's Market with more parking than the Park Ridge market that takes place on Saturday and just as many cute dogs being walked between the stalls.",environment
"I'll be back again, and I can't wait for fall produce to appear!",non-relevant

They could still be there if they wanted.,non-relevant
No signs from the manager of the market stating that was the case.,environment
The South Loop Farmers Market lost a potential customer for next year because of lack of communications.,environment

Glad I finally found a nice farmer's market in Chicago.,non-relevant
"By the way, the biggest produce vendor does accept credit cards which is nice.",non-relevant
You need to make sure you go to this market early in the season.,non-relevant
We went on the last day and the produce was not that great.,quality
A bit rotten honestly.,safety
But the pastries and cheeses were excellent.,quality
They have more to choose from early on in the season and I'm not going to give them a poor rating for something beyond their control.,non-relevant
We'll definitely be back to check them out in the spring!,non-relevant
"Anticipated moving into Lakeview for some time, mainly for easy access to this Saturday market.",non-relevant
"However, I soon found out the difference between one of the city's farmers markets and this French market: choices.",non-relevant
The number of vendors is disappointing as well as the variety of offerings.,availability
Possibly it's the space limitation?,non-relevant
Big on charm but small on substance.,environment
I'll stick with the larger downtown and north side weekday markets.,non-relevant
"This has gone on ever since I have been in Chicago, small but nicely ""curated"" with a well picked collection of desserts, vegetables, and other specialty items.",availability
"However the most I have ever purchased is a scone or cookie, the prices on the produce always seemed a little higher than the better deals in The Corporations.",environment

We're there virtually weekly throughout the season.,non-relevant
Produce is great cheese is great bakery is very good.,quality
We especially like the friendly folks from Klug Farms and the cheese vendor.,environment
This market is small and limited for Lakeview.,environment

And YUM!!!,quality
The pretzel bread there is a weakness of mine!,non-relevant
"The last weekend of the market, I buy about 3 bags of that and freeze it for the winter to enjoy.",non-relevant
The produce I love b/c I find it to be more affordable and better quality than the stores.,quality

"This is a small, neighborhood market, organized by a company that sets up farmers markets in Paris.",environment

The market is open from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. and you can easily combine a trip here with breakfast at one of the many local brunch spots or coffee shops.,non-relevant
Great farmer's market with a unique selection of vendors.,availability
"The big produce stand is great and accepts credit cards, but make sure to check out the bread folks (olive bread) and the cheese stand (string cheese and cheese curds), great stuff.",environment
I love this market too.,non-relevant
Some of the original vendors are still there since it launched (3 yrs ago?) so it's really nice to see them year after year.,non-relevant
The pretzel bread is amazing (seems to be lots of agreement on this).,quality
"The produce is just picked, fresh and wonderful.",quality
I don't buy any vegies at grocery stores when the market is open.,non-relevant

Cons: Slightly small.,environment
I really like this small and sweet lil neighborhood market.,environment
Last Saturday was my first time here and I regret not going here earlier.,non-relevant

A bigger place would probably give more options.,availability
"But nevertheless, the stalls that are present are pretty good.",quality

Great way to spend a weekend morning!,non-relevant
"Spring, hurry up and get here!",non-relevant
"I went to this market today, hoping to find organic vegetables and be able to give my money to the local economy instead of big corporate conglomerates like Albertsons or Safeway.",quality
"I asked one of the guys about some of the vegetables and how they are grown, and I was surprised to find out that they are grown conventionally (hot house and with pesticides).",quality
He didn't seem to know a lot about the vegetables and that the actual owners don't' come out to these farmers markets.,non-relevant
"So I asked if I could pay them a visit, and he told me they dont' take visitors.",non-relevant
Is it because they don't want the public to see their own practices?,non-relevant
Maybe their vegetables are no better than Jewel or Dominicks?,non-relevant
I don't know.,non-relevant
"I also met a woman there who was dressed like she was amish, but after talking to the first guy, it made me wonder if it was a gimmick.",non-relevant
"If you're buying from farmers markets to support local farmers and get organic fresh produce, this is not the one to go to.",quality
"They are slightly more expensive than the chain grocery stores, but it does not seem worth the cost.",quality
"They do have nice crafts there, that I would consider checking out though, I also personally dont' eat any dairy products, so I can't speak about the quality of those items, but I think your money would be better spent on another place's vegetables.",quality

"These folks tell you exactly where you are getting your produce from, so if that's important to you, they've got you covered.",environment
Their carrots here are amazing.,quality
For years we used to buy the baby carrots at the grocery store.,non-relevant

All the produce looked really fantastic and fresh.,quality
There were all sorts of homemade items in jars.,availability
Jams and jellies.,availability
Fresh honey and maple syrup as well.,non-relevant
The only reason I'm giving them a 4 star review is the fact that unless you had a landscaper you could not purchase items out in the fields.,non-relevant
"I get it that many people are fine with hiring a landscaper, but my husband and I prefer to do our own landscaping.",non-relevant
I am not sure why this was a requirement and I hope in the future they will rethink this as it deters probably many more customers.,environment
One of the best farmstand I have been.,non-relevant
Very clean and fun to go around.,safety
Lots of fresh veggies.,quality
Love the onion and the eggs that they sell are the best.,non-relevant
"Love the hot peppers, fresh spinach.....",non-relevant

The ladies are wonderful and wish them the best.,non-relevant
I have been a fan of this farm stand since we discovered it.,non-relevant
And my latest experience there has left much to be desired.,non-relevant
"One of the clerks, a blonde woman with a practical bob was very rude to me and my daughter.",non-relevant
And when we moved from the tomato area she took away every tomato I and my daughter touched.,non-relevant
She accused my daughter if squeezing them when she hadn't.,non-relevant
And for her to talk to a 4 year old and not me directly seemed wrong.,non-relevant
I have no idea what that was about but I will not pay money to be insulted.,non-relevant
There are quite a few farm stands in the area.,availability
And a French market nearby.,non-relevant
I'll take my business elsewhere.,non-relevant
Awesome people and great variety of local (when possible) fruits and veggies.,availability
We come here almost every weekend.,non-relevant

"I bought a half-dozen ears of bi-color corn for $2.50 I believe (they were pre-bundled and I prefer to choose my own from open stock, but the one I pulled out and had a look at looked good, and all the tassels were still golden and sticky, a sign of fresh ears).",quality
"I also got a little bunch of purple radishes, and the lady ringing us up threw in the last remaining bunch of radishes they had for free (it was nearing the end of the day, and ""they just looked so sad by themselves!"") I also nabbed a peach and a Jersey Mac apple -- easy breakfasts, and they looked so much better than the grocery store versions, particularly the apple!",non-relevant
There is also a small selection of potted plants outside for sale.,availability
The bigger selection of plants off to the side are apparently sold only to landscapers.,availability
They are open daily from 9-6 through Halloween.,non-relevant
"So the next time you're fitful for a forkful of the farm but you're cruising by in your convertible on 59, make a pit stop at Wagners and grab some greens.",non-relevant

I am always so sad when it closes for the season.,non-relevant
My favorite farmers market!!,non-relevant
Right in my lovely Florissant hometown!,environment
In and out with all the fresh essentials.,quality
This place features low quality at high prices (with the exception of a few loss leaders to get you in the door).,quality
The fruit is way past its eat by date let alone should be out for sale.,non-relevant
They are also not a credit card friendly establishment.,environment
They require minimum of $10 to use credit.,non-relevant
Who is going to spend $10 on produce that is going to spoil before you can eat it?,non-relevant

Love this place!,non-relevant

Worth stopping if you are in the area.,non-relevant
The Miller Beach Farmer's Market is great.,non-relevant

The guy and I stopped by this market and I could not believe how fantastic the prices were!,non-relevant

Here's some tips....,non-relevant
Too expensive?,environment
This market is one of those markets where the vendor has to grow or make what it's selling.,quality
That means that things are higher quality than other markets where a lot of vendors buy fruit and vegetables in bulk from distributors and resell it.,quality
Want to save money?,non-relevant

Too crowded?,environment
SHOW UP EARLY!,non-relevant
The retired folks do it right.,environment
"Get there before 9am, and you'll avoid the strollers and impatient crowds.",environment
Not finding what you're looking for?,availability

"If you poke around you can find some bargains, but this is the most expensive farmers market I've ever been to unfortunately.",non-relevant
"I cannot for the life of my understand why this market, in the middle of (and close driving distance from) farmland, is priced on average higher than my local Beverly Hills, CA farmer's market.",environment

In one word: Overrated.,non-relevant
"(well, and overpriced).",non-relevant
The prices are outrageous.,environment
"Even if this was in NYC or the West Coast, the prices would still be high.",environment
Music is a mixed bag to put it nicely.,environment
Great place for kids to practice their violin lessons and make some good money.,environment

Yet many people think it's fine art.,non-relevant
"That being said, there are a few surprises worth noting, mainly in specialty food products.",quality
"But honestly, it's not stuff that you can only get there.",non-relevant
Also the crowds and parking is a drag.,environment
And it seems like the prices just keep getting higher yet people race back there even faster.,environment
I think I'll just stick to buying my unglamorous but cheap produce at Meijer...,non-relevant
This is actually one of the best farmers markets I've ever been to!,non-relevant
"Tons of fresh produce, eggs (even the duck variety), meats, and crafts vendors.",availability
Young and talented musicians on very corner.,environment
Lots of great places to grab something to eat as well.,environment

They use eggs and sausage from the local vendors.,non-relevant
"I think Cracked might also use local eggs, but not sure.",non-relevant
"There are your mainstay vendors, but every year there is some turn over with new farmers or artisans that help to make every year a little different.",non-relevant
The live music provided by good and not so good musicians also lends to the character of the market.,environment
It is also nice to peruse the various community groups whom are out there.,environment
"Art mart, Lincoln Square Mall, Common Ground Co-op and downtown Urbana are all right there also.",non-relevant
Several veggie vendors have seconds available to help save a few $ as the market is not as cheap as the grocery store.,availability
"Garlic in particular seems $$ to me, but the varieties have been fun to explore and I hear tell its not as easy to grow and prep for market as onions.",environment
I will also be quite honest it's not just about the food and crafts.,non-relevant
For me the market is very much part of my social life.,environment
"I see so many people I know there every Saturday morning from co-workers, to neighbors, to random friends I have not seen in months.",non-relevant

I then went to the butcher section and decided to see what was going on.,non-relevant
I asked for a pre-packaged pack of chicken thighs and as soon as it was handed to me and I could smell it.,non-relevant
The same thing happened to my roommate days after.,non-relevant
I truly think its only a matter of time before someone gets sick eating their meat here.,non-relevant
But that wasn't all that changed.,non-relevant
"After passing on the chicken thighs, I decided to grab a can of Amy's soup since I didn't trust anything that was cooled or frozen in the store.",non-relevant
I went to the register and she told me it was $3.99 plus tax for the can of soup.,non-relevant
I laughed and walked out.,non-relevant
The old owners were as kind as could be and maintained an immaculate store with the freshest of produce and meat.,quality
"The new owners have turned the place into a horrible smelling, overpriced and an unfriendly store.",quality
