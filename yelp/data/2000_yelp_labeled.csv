It will be worth it!,Non-relevant
Always fun and always great vendors.,environment
"Would prefer if there was some vetting - like local produce only and none shipped in (which just seems decieving at a farmers market, no?) and they really need to move the vendors further into the street to keep it less crowded if they keep the same setup as last year but all in all it is a million times better than a grocery store any day!",Non-relevant
Boley's Farm is located at 151st Street and 81st Court.,Non-relevant
It is a small farm of just 5 acres that the Village of Orland Park purchased a few years ago through its open land acquisition program.,environment
The village's open land program prevents many of these historic properties from being gobbled up by developers for a few more houses.,Non-relevant

It is currently operated by Hank's Farm Stand.,Non-relevant
This is a delightful little farmstand stuck right in the middle of a residential neighborhood...this makes it special as many people miss it but it is worth the trip to find it.,environment

I really really like this Farmer's Market.,Non-relevant

Of course there isn't as much there during the early spring and late fall (given where we live and growing seasons in the region) but they still have the local meat and cheeses and breads.,availability
Second - it's more than just berries and flowers.,availability
So many of the markets are really limited.,Non-relevant

"Fairly pricy, but you get what you pay for, I suppose.",environment
"PARKING TIP: There is a UChicago parking lot at 61st and Kenwood, behind the AT&T building, that does NOT require a parking permit on weekends.",environment
"Probably not the brightest idea to share this, given that I sometimes have to park there myself due to the chaos, but there you go.",environment
"Please save me a space! :) The vendors were pleasant and friendly, if a bit fewer in number than I anticipated.",environment
"The goods are a bit pricier than I expected, but it is the closest one to me since the South Shore one closed up shop.",Non-relevant

"I ended up getting a crepe from one of these folks which was made with fresh greens, mushrooms, pinto beans, and cheese.",availability
"I topped it off with a cup of coffee (serve yourself, honor system) from another vendor.",Non-relevant
On the way out I bought a loaf of Oatmeal bread from another local vendor.,Non-relevant
All in all it was a pleasant way to spend a bit of time on a Saturday morning.,Non-relevant
I'll have to come back from time to time to see what else they have to offer.,Non-relevant
"In addition, they also have cooking classes here which might be helpful to some. this is one of the best farmer's markets in Chicago.",Non-relevant
They have a good selection of produce and a wonderful atmosphere.,availability

I can't wait to see what kinds of produce are available during the summer!,availability

"They even have a market dollars service, where you can purchase coupons with a debit or credit card, a great service for someone like me who rarely has much cash in his pocket.",environment
The Experimental Station on 61st and Blackstone has really blossomed over the past few years.,Non-relevant
"I would like to think that my bringing the Bread and Puppet Theater from Glover, VT, to their space in 2006 helped launch this new era, but whatever it is, the recent developments are making me happy!",Non-relevant
"While it took a few weeks for this market to get on its feet, the result is pretty darn good.",Non-relevant
"It's on its way to becoming a smaller version of the organic mecca Green City Market in Lincoln Park, but it has that close-knit Hyde Park community feel that really warms my heart.",environment
"Because it's not as crowded as other markets, you really get a chance to talk to the farmers, which is great.",environment
"My top picks: the much coveted tomato jelly from Tomato Mountain Farm, triple cream brie with apricots, almonds, and honey from Brett Stamper Cheese, 8-grain bread and eggs from Bruno's organics, veggies from the oh-so-local Windy City Harvest in North Lawndale, and the trail mix scones from the Bleeding Heart Bakery.",availability
"The last time I was there, Bruno's was selling shares for its raw milk.",Non-relevant
"While I'm still on the fence about the product for myself personally, I strongly believe that subversive farming practices are what is going to save the world.",Non-relevant
"After shopping at the market, be sure to pop into the Backstory Cafe for coffee-it's delicious!",quality
Another bonus is that you can buy some groceries and get a minor bicycle problem fixed around the back at the Blackstone Bike Shop.,Non-relevant
A super great place to get fresh fruits & veggies and other items as well.,environment
Friendly people and a great way to support a small business The Farmer's Market has moved indoors for the winter!,environment
"Saturdays, 9am-noon.",Non-relevant
November 8-December 13.,Non-relevant
Details here: http://www.experimentalstation.org/node/118 Great farmers market to have in the neighborhood.,environment
It's small enough to keep busy but not to a point of anxiety.,environment
"It has a great selection of produce, mushrooms and greens especially.",availability
The Michigan Honeycrisp apples are 1) outrageously priced 2) totally worth it.,environment
If all I had was twenty bucks for a week of groceries there's a 100% chance I would spend it all on a dozen of those apples....cos that's all it would get me.,Non-relevant
"Moving on, there are a couple vendors selling crepes and breakfast burritos which is a welcomed bonus on a Saturday morning.",Non-relevant
AND they have a raffle each month and after each purchase you make you're supplied with a ticket to enter.,Non-relevant
I'm a fan.,Non-relevant
"Even if you don't need groceries; crepes, coffee and a raffle, are you kidding me?",Non-relevant
That's a killer way to spend a Saturday morning.,Non-relevant
This was one of the few things I liked when I lived in Hyde Park.,Non-relevant
Good selection of produce - great apple cider in the fall!,availability
"Also, the crepe guy rocks - the cheese and herb crepe, super yum, for a nice lunch post shopping.",Non-relevant
The 61st Street Farmer's Market is a mere toddler in the realm of Chicago's Farmer's Markets.,Non-relevant
"In just its second year, this has quickly become one of my favorites though.",Non-relevant
"Tucked away in a small section where Woodlawn meets the U of C campus, and therefore my 'hood Hyde Park, it is a location that is meant to be kept fairly small.",environment
"Essentially this market has been placed along 61st, just east of Dorchester.",Non-relevant
"It is a very short block and as a result has a small amount of space for stalls- but the organizers of this market (Experimental Station- also located right here) have done a terrific job of ensuring great variety of products and representation in such a small, yet comfortable space.",environment
"This past week, from what I saw, there were: -two different stalls specializing in cheese (funny side story: when a fellow Yelper asked about the differences in the range of blue cheeses being sold- one of them was described as ""tasting like your basement... but in the most delicious way possible!""",quality
"Guess which blue cheese I bought?!?!?); -a farmer who sold free-range chicken eggs (and had the chickens there on display for the children to see) and all cuts of pork raised on her farm; -someone selling lamb, goat, and mutton; -a very popular crepe stand with a busy man cranking out crepes seemingly through the day; -the local bike shop had a space to fix bikes on the spot (I know what I will be doing next Saturday- drop my bike off for an annual ""checkup"" while I shop away); -a stall with fresh herbs, greens and other vegetables (still early in the season for a lot of variety at this point); -another stall selling veg; -two different stalls selling their own salsas, sauces, and salad dressings; -a community organizer spreading the word about the upcoming ""Real Men Can Cook"" event",availability
"I am sure I am forgetting at least a couple of things- but the point is, there is a great amount of variety.",availability
"They accept LINK, WIC, and food stamps- making it a market for everyone to enjoy!",Non-relevant
"They are supposedly working on getting a POS credit card terminal too, which would be awesome.",Non-relevant
"While you are there, might as well stop in to Backstory Cafe- a really nice coffee shop which is a part of Experimental Station and open for anyone to attend during the market.",Non-relevant
"Just north there is a community garden center filled with all sorts of gorgeous flowers, produce, and the occasional garter snake.",Non-relevant
Extremely easy to get to (just off of LSD near the Museum of Science and Industry) with unlimited street parking and tucked away in a really lovely part of town- with a lot to do and see after.,environment
"I suggest everyone give it a try at least once this summer- besides, it is one of the few farmer's markets that is actually on a Saturday in the city.",Non-relevant
"I know I'm northern California spoiled, but I found pretty slim-pickings.",Non-relevant
"Will give it another try, though.",Non-relevant
I really love this market.,Non-relevant
"Not only did I get some great asparagus, cheese and crepe this weekend, I got to visit with neighbors new and old.",Non-relevant
They accept LINK and will double it up to $25 which is great for a neighborhood in a food desert.,environment
"Most of the farms are MI and WI, all are probably within 100 miles of the market.",Non-relevant
Good stuff.,Non-relevant
This place is a staple in my work week.,Non-relevant
I simply couldn't crop it out. ;),Non-relevant
"Whether you are doing some light shopping for hot sauce, pasta, produce, or grabbing a quick bite to eat, this place is affordable and amazing.",Non-relevant
Love it.,Non-relevant
Want some more of it.,Non-relevant
Alas the City Farmer's Markets are bustling with local Farmer's fresh produce!!,Non-relevant
When they First opened this Spring it was more food trucks and tents from nearby restaurants selling quick grab and go lunches or treats.,Non-relevant
Which in of itself is fine except when you really look forward to what the name implies - a Farmer's Market! (Hence the 4 of 5 star rating) There's really nothing better than supporting the local Farmer's and bringing home farm to table produce knowing they are all pesticide free and the money goes right back to them growing beautiful produce Season after Season!!,quality
Just take the grocery shopping off your errands since they are open from May to October because just about anything you could ever want is found here in beautiful abundance and much less costly then the stores plus you actually get to meet the dedicated Farmer's and their families.,Non-relevant
So darn cute!,environment
"Of course everything is seasonal and so what you find may varry but on my most recent visit, I brought home a basket of blueberries, another of cherries and some strawberries, juicy peaches, kale, sweet corn, vine ripe tomatoes, fresh basil and mint, cucumbers, zucchini, eggplant, sweet onions, raw apiary honey and a fresh bouquet of flowers all for under $40!!",availability
Tip: Go a little early and scout out the Perfectly Imperfect boxes... these treasures are slightly blemished but otherwise perfect and a generous box will only run you $5.,Non-relevant
"Thank You Mayor Rahm Emanuel for taking care of Daley Plaza and encouraging all of US in Chicago to ""Cheer"" on the Chicago Cubs in tonight's home game at Wrigley Field in the third game against the Los Angeles Dodgers Playoff Series...I was here today at Daley Plaza and had to take a picture of the fountain that is NOW in CUBBY BLUE!",Non-relevant

Can you Fly the W Flag there?,Non-relevant
Inquiring minds want to know?,Non-relevant
I enjoy going to the farmer's market on Thursday's.,Non-relevant
The same vendors are there every week and I enjoy the atmosphere.,Non-relevant
"The prices, in my opinion, are slightly higher compared to a grocery store but you get to buy from local farms.",environment
"My favorite places are the Amish bakeries (they have donuts, bread, pies, etc) and the mushroom farm (vegan tamales, ravioli, veggie burgers).",environment
Beware!,Non-relevant
"I bought a head of broccoli at one of the vendors and there were small, green caterpillars.",environment
I didn't notice them until I went home.,Non-relevant
There are ways to get ride of them but I stopped buying broccoli out of fear of finding those little critters.,Non-relevant
Just make sure to check your vegetables before buying.,quality
"All in all, it's just a great place to browse and experience.",Non-relevant

"The City Market themes here at Daley plaza and all over, from South Loop to Lincoln park, are what make me proud to live in Chicago.",Non-relevant

"Tons of foot traffic weaving underneath the Chicago Picasso from businesses men/women, tourists, students, and seniors all looking for the same thing: to eat and buy good ingredients.",Non-relevant
"Dozens of little stalls showcasing aromatic baked goods, fresh home-grown vegetables, beekeepers from Indiana, bamboo tabletop decorations, fragrant floral pieces, even fig trees - a culturally abuzz square framed by the tall skyscrapers and under the shadow of Picasso.",availability
"Yes, even if you aren't coming to buy anything, then come for the vivid colors and rush of life you'll experience here (can you tell, these kinds of things inspire me?)",Non-relevant
"A huge shoutout to my friends at Kress Apiary for keeping the bees alive, please do buy their unfiltered, raw, honey (which keeps bits of honeycomb, antioxidants, and nutrients that other honey companies filter out) Smaller farmers market with a great location weekdays in the heart of the loop.",Non-relevant
It's fun to escape the office and walk around to sample the different foods (I always snag a taste of the tofu samples).,environment
"As with a lot of the farmers market, it's pretty much the same vendors that are at all the other farmers markets around the city.",environment
"But, as it gets later in the season, there's a lot more produce at a bit more reasonable prices.",environment
"There's also lots of bakery vendors, some restaurant stands (where you can get lunch food like sandwiches or pad Thai), and flower/plant stands.",environment
When I use to live only a few blocks from Daley Plaza I would venture to this farmer market every so often but I never found much I care to buy.,availability
It's nice to have a farmers market right in the loop but outside that novelty I've been to much better farmers market and as a local or tourist I just tend to breeze right through it.,Non-relevant
"I recently moved to River West, and this Thursday market is the one closest to me.",Non-relevant
"It's not as crowded as a lot of other markets, so you can get the personal attention they lack.",environment
One of the vendors here actually took the time to explain the difference between a leek and a large green onion.,Non-relevant
(Leeks are milder and better for saut_ing and don't get as slimy.),Non-relevant
My favorite bakery booth is the Amish one.,Non-relevant
"I'm not sure if these women are really Amish, or if they're just actors dressed up to look Amish (hey...",Non-relevant
I've seen Witness).,Non-relevant
But I'm leaning toward authentic because they don't pluck their eyebrows.,Non-relevant
The Amish purple wheat bread with nuts is delish.,Non-relevant
"But if you don't buy it before lunchtime, they usually run out.",Non-relevant
The best produce is in the booth in the photo below.,quality
"They have the best quality tomatoes, leeks and even golden beats... even my Whole Foods didn't have golden beets this summer.",availability
My Yelp app found a Starbucks a half block away on Washington.,Non-relevant

I love this market!,Non-relevant
Magical.,Non-relevant
The Farmer's market transforms the usually hectic city corner into a blissful bazaar.,Non-relevant
On a nice day it's pretty hard to convince yourself to go back to work.,Non-relevant
Thursdays have become my favorite day of the week!,Non-relevant
Everything is so reasonably priced.,environment
You'll pay more at Whole Foods for practically everything at the market.,availability
The vendors are nice and everything is fresh.,quality
There is something for everyone.,availability
From fresh flowers to homemade cakes and candy or even just a quick getaway from the office!,availability
Stop by for a jar of honey or an Amish donut before it's too late!,Non-relevant

And I LOVE being there at the lunch time.,Non-relevant
On Wednesdays- Art Festival.,Non-relevant

You can smell the roses here.,Non-relevant
Eat some organic tomatoes & strawberries.,availability
See what other culture means.,Non-relevant
Listen to good music.,environment
Even dance.,Non-relevant
See u there :) P This is the best farmers market in Chicago for several reasons:,Non-relevant
1,Non-relevant
"It offers the cheapest produce in the city - tomatoes for $2/lb instead of $4 or even $5 in the neighborhood markets (There's a specific vendor from the Indianapolis area that has the best tomato selection around), inexpensive flowers, great selection of produce throughout the season at very reasonable prices.",availability
2,Non-relevant
It's conveniently located steps away from the Washington blue line stop.,Non-relevant
3,Non-relevant
There are places to sit.,Non-relevant
4,Non-relevant
"It begins before 9 a.m., unlike certain neighborhood markets (I'm looking at you, Logan Square...what kinda start time is 10 a.m.?!)",Non-relevant
5,Non-relevant
"It's downtown, close to Michigan Ave and State Street shopping.",Non-relevant
ENJOY!,Non-relevant
Go get some tomatoes from the Indianapolis fellas!,availability
"I've been to Daley Plaza's FM about 8-10 times over the many years and overall it's ok but a Farmers Market, it really isn't.",Non-relevant
"It's more of a collection of specialty items that, while intriguing and somewhat unique, don't really rep a FM, apart from logistics.",availability
"If you're looking for tons of fresh fruits, veggies and produce, well, you might want to look elsewhere.",availability
These are the items i look for when going to a place like this.,availability
"As a side, when going to the (WI) Brunkow Cheese booth, I inquired about their awesome product in a few of Chicago's notable restaurants to which they responded in utter confusion with a side of attitude.lol.",Non-relevant
"Hey Brunkow, if you're being featured in restaurants by your namesake, you might want to have the ppl representing your product/company have a basic understanding of where you are being served.",Non-relevant
Just sayin.,Non-relevant
I pass by they have like Google festival and computer science Also see ppl setting having their lunch on the areas w/tables and chairs then the fountain is very relaxing I made a mistake in ordering a shrimp sandwich from Amazing Shrimp the other day.,Non-relevant
"I've never thought of Hammond, IN as shrimp experts, or shrimp anything, but I figured, maybe they're transplants from a place where they do know shrimp.",Non-relevant
"Anyways, all I can say is UGH!",Non-relevant
Nothing is much worse than feeling gross for the remainder of the day.,Non-relevant
"The guy behind the tent thankfully dropped the garlic salt housed in a glass container, right before my order, or I would have been treated to a salt bath with what was termed a shrimp sandwich.",Non-relevant
The sammy was all about a huge brioche roll.,Non-relevant
"After that fluffy/puffy 2 inch high, 3 inches wide piece of shiny bread, I couldn't tell you much about the shrimp, as I couldn't taste it and only saw 1 chopped up and swimming in a mayo and cabbage sea.",Non-relevant
There was seriously A LOT of mayo - i tons of dripping mayo and messy cabbage hanging over the bread.,Non-relevant
It was more like a slaw sandwich with a medium sized shrimp as an afterthought.,Non-relevant
"For $13.00, that was about the biggest rip off the market has to offer.",Non-relevant
"Now, Brunkow Cheese of WI is the antithesis of the shrimp sammy.",Non-relevant
Everything from the aroma to the taste to the price was so perfect.,quality
Absolutely wonderful cheese!!!! 5 stars for the Brunkow family of cheese.,quality
"A few weeks ago, the best asparagus for a buck a bunch were here.",quality
"They were thin and green and delicious - so good, they were tasty raw.",quality
"Not to forget, a huge bargain!!",Non-relevant
Prices for cherries are high - or higher than Organic cherries delivered to my door...so I thought that was a bit odd for non-organics to be higher than organic.,quality
They looked tasty for the cherry devotees like me.,quality
There's a guy that makes AMAZING cakes and has samples out to tempt customers even further.,environment
If there were more than 2 of us to devour a cake I would buy one in a heartbeat.,Non-relevant
"Every flavor I've tried is decadent, flavorful, delicious and so moist.",quality
Great time at this farmers market!!!!,Non-relevant
"The variety is unbelievable, something for everyone.",availability
If you're in the city when the market is happening stop by!!!!!,Non-relevant
This is a great place to get lunch if you are downtown.,environment
"The prices are equal to or less than what you would pay in a restaurant and you can be assured of organic, non-gmo fare.",quality
I love Gayle's cheese sandwiches but they also have the longest line.,Non-relevant
"However, just down from Gayle's is a tamale shop on the southwest corner that serves organic vegan tamales 2 for $5 that are to die for!",quality
This particular market seems to lean more towards prepared foods for consumption probably because there is such a huge supply of rabid lunch fanatics.,Non-relevant
"However there is an ample selection of organic vegetables, meat, fruits, and normal farmers market-type items for sale.",availability
This market runs from mid-May to the end of October and is famous as the longest running farmers market in Chicago.,Non-relevant
The hours from 7 AM to 3 but many of the stalls stay open later so you can stop and pick something up for the ride home if you're lucky.,Non-relevant
Another great part of this great city is the various farmers markets.,environment
I was able to stop at this market and check things out.,Non-relevant
"Due to the location which is right outside of the Daley Plaza so you can pick up vegetables, fruits or flowers when you are leaving the courts, heading to work or during your lunch break.",availability
The market starts in the morning and ends early afternoon.,Non-relevant
The prices are okay for location.,environment
Great people watching.,environment
Go and enjoy this market.,Non-relevant
What an adorable little market!,environment
"They have pretty much everything you would expect (fresh pasta, plants, vegetables, dog treats, etc.) right in the middle of the loop.",availability
"I got a grilled cheese breakfast sandwich from Gayle's, which I will forever compare all future grilled cheeses against.",Non-relevant
Passed this twice before actually stopping to check it out.,Non-relevant
"Kinda lame in May, though...",Non-relevant
"Great people, great corn.",environment
"Freshest produce around,and their children are polite and darn good looking too.",quality
The corn on the cob was so sweet and delicious our family of four polished off a bag of 15 cobs in one sitting!,quality
So yummy. 15 cobs for $4.99.,quality
"We also bought a very good, sweet and juicy watermelon.",quality
We spent only ten dollars our first trip there.,Non-relevant
We will be hitting this farm stand again VERY soon!,Non-relevant
Love this place!,Non-relevant
The corn on the cob is my absolute favorite!,Non-relevant
I find myself frequenting Brandau's multiple times a week during the summer.,Non-relevant
All of the produce is fresh and tasty.,quality
This place has THE BEST Michigan peaches you will ever taste.,quality
It's family owned and the guys there couldn't be nicer.,environment
"Visiting the Glen Ellyn French Market was a bit of a surprise, since my family and I are used to the bustling Saturday market in Wheaton.",Non-relevant
"From what I gather, this market is newer, maybe still getting rolling.",Non-relevant
"It happens on Sundays, from 9am to 2pm, in the parking lot at the corner of Crescent Blvd and Glenwood Ave.",environment
It's expected to continue until the end of October.,Non-relevant
"On our visit here, there were a couple farms selling produce, several bakeries, stands selling granola, tea, iced coffee, sausage and cheeses.",availability
A lady was selling Usbourne books (love those!).,Non-relevant
Hmm what am I missing?,Non-relevant
"Oh yea, two guys were making the most delicious chicken tacos.",quality
The amount of vendors and the crowd size are definitely more manageable than the Saturday market in Wheaton.,environment
"I didn't care for the iced coffee I tried, which had me missing my Saturday cup from I Have A Bean.",Non-relevant
"I'd skip that next time, but the rest of the market is worth checking out.",Non-relevant
"If you see the guys grilling chicken, you must try a taco!",Non-relevant
I've just returned from a shopping trip to the Glen Ellyn French Market.,Non-relevant
I arrived at about 12:30 on a spectacularly beautiful fall day.,Non-relevant
"Despite it being close to closing time, every vendor's booth was well stocked.",Non-relevant
"Not a lot of vendors compared to Wheaton and even little Warrenville, but there is a decent choice of ""farmers"", meat purveyors, bakers, and random sellers of jewelry and olive oil.",availability
"That said, the biggest negative is the lack of shoppers.",Non-relevant
I am not exaggerating when I say that I could count them on one hand- (and I think that 2 of them might have been vendors looking for something to do) Every time I've gone this summer I've been shocked at how unsupported this market feels.,Non-relevant
It's like going into a store where I am the only shopper- the help just stares and hovers it's all I can do to keep from bolting out the door.,Non-relevant
I'm not sure why this is the case.,Non-relevant
Maybe the move from Friday to Sunday wasn't such a great move (not that Friday packed 'em in either).,Non-relevant
Perhaps moving it to Sunday AFTERNOON would be better?,Non-relevant
At least then a few downtown stores would be open too.,Non-relevant
Add some music or something to give it a more festive buzz?,environment
Right now it feels awkward and just plain dead.,Non-relevant
"I am moving from Cedar Rapids, and you have absolutely no idea how much I am going to miss the Downtown Farmers Market.",Non-relevant
I love walking around downtown in the blocked off areas and shopping.,Non-relevant
There is such an amazing variety of things to purchase!,availability
"Lawn ornaments, food, kettle corn (mmmm), jewelry, cutting boards, plants, produce, breakfast burritos, you name it.",availability
"I had my favorite vendors that I always hit up, but I loved going to every shop and checking out what is new.",Non-relevant
"It's a great place to take visiting friends and family, and it is friendly for all tastes of style and food.",environment
Everyone we ever took there fell in love just as much as I did.,Non-relevant
I will definitely be driving back a few weekends this summer to attend!,Non-relevant
I love it!,Non-relevant
The night market was fun but busy...,environment
I'm sure the next one will be more organized to handle the crowd.,environment
"First off, lets call it what it is people, it's a french market, not a farmers market.",Non-relevant
"Supposedly one of the largest 'farmers' markets in the Midwest, and I'd believe it.",Non-relevant
"At least 8 blocks of produce, meat, baked goods, jewelry, crafts, and street food vendors.",availability
I didn't check *every* produce vendor but the ones I did notice were all from Iowa.,Non-relevant
I wish I had a cooler big enough to bring some organic free range chickens raised in Iowa all the way home to Chicago.,quality
It's a pity this market is only every other weekend.,Non-relevant
By 8:30 the streets were packed and a few vendors were running out of green beans and cherries already.,availability
Only open till noon so get up early and wander around downtown Cedar Rapids before all the good stuff is gone!,Non-relevant
This is a pretty good Farmers Market.,environment
It's definitely the largest in the area.,environment
They have nearly everything you could want and some of the vendors even take EBT.,availability
Parking is always an issue when you have such a gigantic event.,environment
No problem - I just ride the bicycle down there.,Non-relevant
It's more convenient and also lets me limit the amount of things purchased.,environment
"Being a minimalist who lives in a van (by choice), I can tell you this is a ""grazer's"" paradise!",Non-relevant
There are lots of samples - enough for a free meal.,availability
The only thing I really don't like is that dogs are permitted in the farmer's market.,environment
I think this poses a health and safety concern.,safety
It's only a matter of time until something happens - a child is bitten or there is a dog fight or I step in dog sh** ....,safety
About a month ago I saw a large dog lean forward and lick a cucumber sitting near the edge of a table.,safety
Gross!,safety
The other thing that bothers me has been mentioned before: One week the event is in the downtown area.,Non-relevant
The other week it is much smaller and located near 8th Avenue.,environment
I wish we could have it one way or the other.,Non-relevant
A couple of times I've gone to the larger downtown site hoping for something only to find the smaller market was being held a few blocks away.,environment
"For the dog issue and the inconvenience of not having the market in the same place each week, I'm going to deduct two stars.",environment
I've witnessed several incidents with dogs and don't feel comfortable with them being permitted in here.,environment
Mark my words - it's only time till something bad happens.,Non-relevant
"If I get bitten, the owner is getting sued as well as the city for its negligence.",Non-relevant
"Other than those minor little things, I think this is a decent event and am glad we have it in Cedar Rapids.",environment
It shows what can be accomplished when we all support a great idea..,Non-relevant
You will ask yourself how I can write a mostly negative review of one of the best Farmer's Market around and still give it 4 stars.,Non-relevant
So I will explain.,Non-relevant
The Downtown Farmer's Market is a outstanding venue and is one of the largest in the nation and probably in the state.,Environment
I have been involved with it every since it first started both as a buyer and as a concessioner.,Non-relevant
Over the years the market has expanded to extend for many city blocks and attracts vendors from miles around.,Non-relevant
The downtown market is not a true Farmer's Market in that it allows non-food vendors as well.,Non-relevant
"You will see people selling everything from jewelry to candles; food sellers from local restaurants, wine, clothing, local charities, entertainers, and so on.",availability
Among all the vendors are actual produce sellers.,Non-relevant
A list of most vendors can be found on the Downtown Market website.,Non-relevant
It is a huge and fabulous Saturday event.,Non-relevant
And yet I prefer to skip it in favor of other Farmer's Markets which are smaller and more produce oriented for the following reasons.,Non-relevant
1,Non-relevant
It is VERY crowded.,environment
"Attendance is high (easily topping 16,000 per Saturday morning) and the jostling and shoving can be overwhelming at times.",Non-relevant
You will find a lot to purchase but you will leave exhausted.,Non-relevant
2,Non-relevant
It has become so big that you will find it difficult to find the vendors you really want to buy from among the 220 + vendors.,environment
We are talking about 11 streets here and no printed map to guide you.,Non-relevant
3,Non-relevant
The crowding is aggravated by carts and strollers making it difficult for challenged walkers to navigate.,environment
I recommend that seniors try the smaller markets instead.,environment
4,Non-relevant
The organizers still have not learned to ban dog walkers.,environment
"You will have to dodge leases, the infrequent dog fight, and other canine problems.",environment
Just think a minute.,Non-relevant
What would you think if you saw people walking the aisles of the local supermarket with a dog?,environment
What we have in the Cedar Rapids Downtown Market is a great market that has gotten a bit too big and needs to be trimmed down.,environment
"I am a long-time fan of Farmer's Markets and have attended them for many years, long before the downtown market even existed, but my preference is for the smaller markets, which I visit once a week religiously.",Non-relevant
The downtown market is only an occasional thing.,Non-relevant
A great place to spend a summer Saturday morning.,Non-relevant
"There are over 200 vendors ranging from prepared food, wine, candles, crafts and jewelry and even...produce!",availability
The downtown farmers market attracts thousands of people (and hundreds of pets) at each event on the first and third Saturday from June to thru Sept.,Non-relevant
"Open from 7:30 to noon, you'll need to come early to get some of the most popular items.",Non-relevant
The downtown CR farmers market is never a disappointment!,Non-relevant
Roll out of bed and start your Saturday morning right.,Non-relevant
They have plenty of options for a quick breakfast while browsing the market.,Non-relevant
I love love love the jewelry offered-picked up some of the cutest earrings for cheap!,Non-relevant
The market has quite a few wine vendors that are great.,environment
You cannot beat the prices of fruits and veggies here.,environment

We absolutely love going to the Cedar Rapids Downtown farmers market.,Non-relevant
There is something for everyone there and the produce is very economical.,quality
This market is surprisingly large and diverse for Cedar Rapids and it is always great to see so many people out and about in downtown.,environment

A fantastic summer event in the area and outstanding compared to many farmer's markets.,environment

I do visit this market a few times between May and October.,Non-relevant
SOME of the craft vendors are mighty proud of their wares as evidenced by their high prices.,environment

I do understand that it is hard to put a price on your time but some of the prices being charged are ridiculous.,environment

You can't even make a deal with them.,Non-relevant
They will not haggle.,Non-relevant
"If they really want to sell their wares, they should have some leeway.",Non-relevant

"They pass themselves off as local producers, but I think it's all a sham.",Non-relevant
"I'm not sure about the melons, but the corn and tomatoes certainly aren't locally grown.",availability
"I had my suspicions when I spotted the commercial produce boxes under the table that said ""Arkansas Tomatoes.""",quality
"So I asked about the origin of the tomatoes that had all the characteristics of a store bought tomato and they answered, ""Ohio"". They said the corn came from Muscatine, so I bought a bag.",quality
I couldn't wait to have my first bite of summer with a juicy ear of Iowa sweet corn.,quality
Only problem was it tasted exactly like the flavorless Florida corn you buy in the grocery store.,quality
"If you want commercially grown produce shipped from far away, then save yourself some time and money and get it at Wal-Mart.",Non-relevant
I'm pretty sure that's where these people get their inventory.,Non-relevant

Everyone I've met is really friendly.,environment

Our favorite thing is to ride our bikes over on Saturday morning.,Non-relevant

"Convenient access to downtown Wheaton for whatever else you may need/want (i.e. the library, Carlson's hardware, etc.)",environment
"When I lived in Illinois, I loved this French Farmers Market in Wheaton.",Non-relevant
It had to be one of my first stops when I came back to town.,Non-relevant
My favorite memory about this market was buying a huge tropical beach painting from one of the vendors.,Non-relevant
It was one of my hubby and I's wedding presents to each other.,Non-relevant
This time around it was as great as I thought it would be.,Non-relevant
"They have tons of little local vendors selling their crafts, food, popcorn, ice teams, clothes, flowers, jewelry, and home d_cor.",availability
There's a lot to see and several rows of it.,Non-relevant
It has a nice location by the train station and steps from Downtown Wheaton.,environment
One thing that I noticed after the fact when I had already been through the market is that they are not dog friendly.,environment
My dog was walking all throughout the market with no problem.,Non-relevant
"Than at the end, I see the small sign that says no dogs allowed.",environment
I don't understand how that could be the case when this is outside.,Non-relevant
"Either way, no one stopped us with him walking around and it was fine.",Non-relevant
"Another thing is that there really aren't that many food vendors as I thought that would be. there was a popcorn vendor, a bakery, some coffee, and maybe about 2 or 3 more food vendors.",availability
"There was not much selection, so if you are hungry just keep that in mind and check out something in downtown Wheaton.",availability
I'm taking one star off simply because it gets PACKED!,quality
As in you can't move while attempting to walk through the aisles.,environment
"And then people bring their kids, strollers, and dogs, and you think all hell is about to break loose.",environment
The assortment of vendors is great though.,availability
"Flowers, produce, meats, bakery, coffee, jewelry, skincare, etc.",availability
"It's all there, and it's all beautiful and wonderful.",quality
I love it when vendors give out samples - we bought several things we otherwise wouldn't have!,environment
Definitely get there early!,Non-relevant
"By 10am, you could see inventory had already starting to decline.",Non-relevant
"Plenty of other shops and restaurants to visit while your in the area, and a beautiful little walking path by the library as well!",Non-relevant
Overrated and overcrowded.,environment
Go here when they open and a lot of stuff isn't set up.,Non-relevant
Go here late and a lot of stuff is sold out.,Non-relevant
Go here in the middle and the parking lot on Willow is really backed up and precarious.,environment
"Totally crowded at 10:30AM, can't even move.",environment
Now here's where my complaining really begins:,Non-relevant
"I know it's a ""French market"" and not a ""farmers' market"" but the fact that this place is 9-10x more jewelry and pastries than produce is ridiculous.",Non-relevant
"That's kind of depressing, and the little bit of farmer's stands is not super great either.",environment
"Out of this whole place, only one is organic produce.",quality
Just one stand.,Non-relevant
And they sell out of stuff QUICK.,Non-relevant
The other places have been mostly disappointing.,environment
"Instead of growing and selling spring crops locally in the spring, they'd rather sell summer crops from Florida.",Non-relevant
And they all had these southern Illinois strawberries that were all bruised and looked like they were going bad.,quality
It seems like they all got them from the same distributor/farm or whatever.,Non-relevant
They aren't selling things they grow for the most part.,quality
The one nice thing I got was some Michigan hydroponic tomatoes that were very fresh and broccoli.,quality
"Let's hope they taste as good as they look, and let's hope the southern Illinois strawberries (which I got out of curiosity) taste a whole lot better than they look.",quality
I thought local food was supposed to be fresher than grocery store food?,quality
Not always.,Non-relevant
Maybe those tomatoes will bring me back to fight the crowds next week but they'd have to be pretty damn good.,environment
Came here for my first time today as it was beautiful a outside and wanted to check out the local fare.,Non-relevant
"Tasted some locally produced honey, breads and kettle corn.",quality
"They had pretty broad selection of clothes, crafts and foods available from different local vendors.",availability
"Found some fresh model mushrooms available that had been picked in Wisconsin and considering I didn't find any this year, 10 bucks for a seasonal delicacy wasn't a bad deal!!",availability
Indulge much?,Non-relevant
I had such a great time choosing my indulgences at this market!,Non-relevant
And most were within reason.,Non-relevant
It was a win-win!,Non-relevant
We went earlier in the day to avoid the crowds that gather here in downtown Wheaton.,Non-relevant
"But by the time we left, it was getting crowded and the strollers had made their way to the aisles.",environment
"So yes, come early.",Non-relevant
I started making purchases almost immediately.,Non-relevant
I think that may have been a mistake.,Non-relevant
Similar vendors had similar products at a lower cost as I moved up and down the aisles.,Non-relevant
"If you have the time, I would encourage you to look at everything and then make your decisions.",Non-relevant
But if there's a limited supply of things - get it while the getting is good!,availability
Let's talk about some of my favorites...,Non-relevant
We tried some honey.,Non-relevant
It was marvelous!,Non-relevant
Different honey combos jarred up and ready to go.,Non-relevant
They even had mini jars available so you could take home a variety.,availability

"Thank you, Bron's Bee Honey!!",Non-relevant
St. Roger Abbey was there complete with nuns and baked goods.,Non-relevant

They had a nice variety of produce to offer and I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from this local vendor again!,availability
I tried tea from two different vendors.,Non-relevant
"Both were good, but I preferred The Tea House.",Non-relevant
The gentleman working that booth really knew his stuff and I was sold on the Tea-Vine without even tasting it.,Non-relevant
I've since tasted it and it's exactly as he described.,quality
Nice!,Non-relevant
"There were at least two meat vendors, but I was wooed by Farm Fresh Foodstuffs.",Non-relevant
Yet another knowledgable man in the crowd.,environment
He had a lot to say and I ended up a big fan after a few minutes of chatting.,Non-relevant
I bought two different types of bacon.,Non-relevant
My girlfriend bought ground beef.,Non-relevant
And it looks like they may be able to help with a raw diet for a special Princess I know. :-),Non-relevant
Hahn's Bakery from Geneva was here.,
"I am already a day of Hahn's, so I was on the hunt for a kitchen sink cookie, but alas they did not bring those for the day.",Non-relevant
"Although, I did hear they were asked by multiple people, so it may make its way into their French Market inventory in the future.",Non-relevant
You never know...,Non-relevant
What they did provide were fresh baked pretzel rolls and still warm donuts.,availability
"No, not warm from the sun...but warm from the onsite fryer.",Non-relevant
They're making that magic happen on the premises.,Non-relevant
It was a perfect way to wrap up a delicious morning at the market!,Non-relevant
"This French Market is everything a French Market should be, so it's very crowded!",environment
"Here you'll find fresh crepes, beautiful flowers, fruit and vegetables, handcrafted soaps, jewelry, knick knacks, it has it all.",availability
"There's 4 aisles of local fare and most of the vendors are friendly, save the jewelry lady who was extra snarky.",environment
My top pic for jewelry here is Adorn512.,Non-relevant
Such a delicate and unique but trendy selection.,availability
About the crowds though.,environment
I'd recommend either coming early to avoid them and have first pick of the best produce.,Non-relevant
I love spending my Saturday mornings walking around Farmer's Markets.,Non-relevant
I've been to the Wheaton French Market three times already since moving to Wheaton.,Non-relevant
The vendor offerings are pretty good and I always find myself leaving with at least a few goodies.,availability
"You can find expect to find macarons, coffee, pastries, bread, olives, pickles, dog treats, jewelry, gluten-free goodies and don't forget about the fruits and veggies.",availability
The good: -You're supporting small business owners and farmers -It's a good way to discover new products or items you haven't tried before -All your favorite Wheaton businesses are in one convenient location -Lots of vendors take both cash and cards!,environment
Huge pro,Non-relevant
The meh: -No dogs allowed.,environment
"Although my dogs aren't well behaved enough to visit such an event, I always love meeting other dog owners and seeing the pups around. -The space itself is incredibly narrow-- which probably has a lot to do with why no dogs are allowed. -Parking is tough unless you get here right when it starts or a little before.",environment
You might find yourself driving in circles for parking for awhile.,environment
I was here at 745 one morning and had my share of parking spots.,environment
The bad: -No real cons that would keep me from coming,environment
I'll continue coming to The French Market as long as the weather and my work schedule allows.,Non-relevant
It's a great way to spend a relaxing Saturday morning.,Non-relevant
My favorite Saturday morning destination!,Non-relevant

Get lost in the crowd!,environment
This market has a variety of things!,availability
"From fresh veggies, fresh fruit, fresh crepes, fresh coffee, fresh smiles!",availability
Just a lovely place to be on a Saturday morning.,Non-relevant
Plenty of seating and people are so pleasant.,Non-relevant
Maybe this market has declined since the previous reviews.,Non-relevant
It is messy.,safety
"The vendors are crammed into, too small of an area making it uncomfortable to navigate THEM AND the patrons who feel it necessary to bring strollers or walking dogs.",environment
"I LIKE kids and dogs, but the little ones get bags in their faces, trip people up and see only butts and legs (and dogs).",environment
Both are safety hazards.,safety
There are also too few garbage bins and it is common to see used toothpicks from samples littering the food product tables.,environment
"This market has 3 notable vendors, cheese; pretzel/bread and knife sharpener.",availability
All others are price-gougers and slopping messers!,availability
A wonderful and pretty large farmer's market.,environment
"Great choice of local and seasonal veggies, fruits, cheese, pastries, breads, coffee, tea, crepes, jams, jellies, mustards, jewelry, accessories, etc.",availability
There was even a little live music.,environment
"The only downfall was that there was only 1 booth containing any meat or eggs, and by 10:30am the eggs were sold out.",Non-relevant
I purposely wear a scarf whenever i come here to get the true FRENCH market experience.,Non-relevant
Just kidding.,Non-relevant
(No I'm not).,Non-relevant
"Oh, that, and pretty much dodging all the bees flying around all the vendors with sweets and produce.",environment
This is one of the best markets in the Illinois suburbs. 4 rows of local arts and crafts and also baked goods and produce.,Non-relevant
Love the fall season especially because of the squashes.,Non-relevant
My favorite so far are acorn and butternut.,Non-relevant
"It's decently priced...you may find it to be cheaper at the grocery but hey, its a french market.",Non-relevant
My Saturday mornings have been spent here for the past 2 weeks.,Non-relevant
My advice: stop by the vendors with the baked goodies.,Non-relevant
Best find so far among the bakery vendors was a loaf of Chocolate chip pumpkin bread.,availability
Pair that with a hot mug of apple cider and you're seriously on cloud 9.,Non-relevant
"Oh and yes, they have a crepes station!",Non-relevant
Wow!,Non-relevant
LOVE this French Market!,Non-relevant

"OMG, YES!), a grilled cheese shop, and others I can't possibly remember.",Non-relevant
"The earlier you get there the better as there is a lot to see but it's all crammed in a very small area - and once those mommies wielding their double-wide ankle destroyers, um, I mean, strollers, get out & about, it's a bit cramped.",environment
"I wish it was adjacent to a park so you could take a break from the crowd and sit down to enjoy your lunch, breakfast or snack you will inevitably buy while there.",environment
At least there is parking garage next door so parking is a breeze!,environment
The local farmer's market is my go to place for my local honey.,environment
"This farmers market is really great, however, it can be difficult to navigate with the crowds while finding a place to park.",environment
For parking and convenience I usually opt for parking in the parking garage just south of the train tracks.,environment
While at the market the are two main aisles that have vendors of all kinds.,Non-relevant
"You can find anything from tea, to homemade dog treats, to flowers for your garden, there are even a couple of food truck/vendors.",availability
"And if you are fortunate to walk the aisles during the month of May, the fragrance from the lilac bushes located between the farmers market and the train tracks waft thought the aisles, it's truly a great experience.",Non-relevant
"Cool concept, very poor experience though.",environment
As others have stated this market has wonderful variety.,availability
Tons of vendors and many types of goodies to buy.,availability
But...get ready for my rant...,Non-relevant
People I have a dog that I adore and we take him lots of place with us but I make sure it's an appropriate place like a park.,environment
Why a bunch of you think it's cute to bring Fido with you to an over crowded outdoor market with very cramped quarters makes no sense to me.,environment
I loved the lady with two dogs trying to navigate the super narrow aisles.,environment
"Next, leave the damn stroller at home!!!!",Non-relevant
"If your precious child cannot walk on their own, than don't come or leave the baby home with dad or mom.",Non-relevant
Seriously!,Non-relevant
One woman had a double-wide stroller AND a dog and was sipping on her Starbucks oblivious to the traffic jam she was causing.,environment
"Sorry Wheaton, other burbs and Chicago neighborhoods have got the Farmers Market thing down.",Non-relevant
Yours needs some help.,Non-relevant
"Hint, move it to an area that is not so crowded.",environment
We won't be back.,Non-relevant
"This was perfect on this cool, fall morning.",Non-relevant
There are great stands with a wide variety of items.,availability
"The fresh baked goods are wonderful, a large selection of large and unusually shaped and colored pumpkins, fresh and locally grown fruits and vegetables, fresh flowers, some craft items, honey from a local farm, cheeses, popcorn, canned salsas and pickles, homemade jams and jellies, it goes on.",availability
"I have not yet tried the strawberry banana bread, sounds like it will make a great lunch.",availability
Stop and take a look around.,Non-relevant
It really is one of the better local farmers markets.,Non-relevant
"The Wheaton French Market is a good place to go if you're looking for a variety of food, not all of it French.",availability
I suppose the most French thing about this market is the crepe stand; the crepes there are freshly made and taste fantastic.,quality
"There's a *lot* of bread as well, and there are some nuns sell both savory and sweet bread.",Non-relevant
Vegetables and fruit can be hit or miss.,Non-relevant
"If it's out of season in the midwest, expect the fruit you find to be trucked up from Florida.",Non-relevant
"Nothing wrong with that, and the peaches *were* good... but next time I'll wait the extra month.",quality
"It's conveniently located in downtown Wheaton and there's always a bustle of activity, live music, many pounds of frozen blueberries (which we did get one year; they were very good)... in generally, this is what I would expect a farmers' market to be.",Non-relevant
I would consider myself a farmer's market junkie.,Non-relevant
Today we missed Naperville's due to yoga so we ventured out to Wheaton which is open till 2pm.,Non-relevant
Long and short of it: we won't be back.,Non-relevant
1: the aisles.,Non-relevant
Everyone has done a great job punting out they are too narrow.,Non-relevant
It's horrid!,Non-relevant
We aren't in Paris!,Non-relevant
Spread it out a little more.,Non-relevant
"2: the non-food vendors: while I understand this is a French Market, the numerous vendors peddling various other goods just cramps up the area.",Non-relevant
We only came for food!,Non-relevant
"3: the ""grocery"" produce: perhaps my biggest irk.",quality
"We go to farmers markets to buy local, supporting the local farmers, to eat in the season and get the freshest, whole foods we can.",Non-relevant
How in the world are tomatoes from Arizona(as it said on the box) fit in that?,Non-relevant
Some purveyors had so any different varieties of produce that it was obvious that they are not growing them but purchasing them at wholesale and turning a profit on people none the wiser.,availability
Talk to the vendors people!,Non-relevant
"I found a certified organic farm from Michigan that was able to fulfill my need for cucumbers, tomatoes and kale but some of you may of bought the same stuff being sold at Mariano's down the street!",availability
A few reviewers said that the food was more expensive than the grocery store.,Non-relevant
It can be.,Non-relevant
"But we pay more to support the local farmers and sometimes it's a better deal than the chemically enhanced, grown in a lab, cross bred stuff found at the grocery store.",environment
You pay a premium to eat good the way it looks grown from a seed with little to no human intervention!!,Non-relevant
In the end we won't come back.,Non-relevant
There are so many farmers markets now and this one for the reasons above is just not worth the time.,Non-relevant
Hmmmm...,Non-relevant
"Parking is rough, the crowds are absurd, and I can't say the selection is any more amazing than I can get in Naperville.",environment
I'm glad I went but I don't think I'll go back anytime soon.,Non-relevant
"This is a great farmers market with a large selection of produce from several vendors, as well as some meat and dairy, and non-food items like bird seed and gift items.",availability
It can get crowded and the location doesn't have a lot of great parking nearby - but the selection and prices are worth it.,environment
"Whatever you do, if you bring your dog, look out for idiots who don't watch their dogs and use retractable leashes.",environment
Some stupid polish chick and her idiot boyfriend on Sunday had a little rat looking dog that they let come over by my dog and tangle the leash all up and of course my dog was annoyed and growled at their stupid dog and they blamed me.,environment
Be aware.....I will not be taking my nice dog there anymore because of stupid dog owners.,environment
"While I was in town a couple weeks ago, my parents invited us to tag along with them on a Sunday morning trip to the Lions Farmer's Market.",Non-relevant
"The market wasn't really around (or it was small) while I lived in town years ago, so I was pretty shocked to find out how large and diverse it was (I also commend my parents for shopping here).",environment
The entire [long] parking lot of the train station is occupied for this market -- with a good crowd of people and dogs.,environment
"It's bigger than the Schaumburg Farmer's Market, which is usually my favorite in the 'burbs. All your food bases are covered: veggies (soooo many delicious veggies at different booths), breads, sauces, fruits, meat, eggs, etc.",availability
"Several craft booths were present, including one with stunning dried & decorated gourds.",Non-relevant
It fascinated me.,Non-relevant
"At one end of the market was a taco booth, with fresh tacos for people to enjoy while they look around.",Non-relevant
"I don't know if the booths I saw are the same that show up every week, but man, I was impressed.",Non-relevant
Definitely check out this market if you're in the area and looking for ways to support local farmers & businesses.,environment
"This is one of the few farmer's markets on the weekend, so us M-F working stiffs in the 'burbs can enjoy it!",Non-relevant
It's every Sunday June through October.,Non-relevant
"It's not huge like the French Market in Wheaton, but it has just enough of everything to have most of the bases covered.",availability
"There were plenty of fresh fruit & veggies, an olive vendor who also had fresh pita bread, a cheese vendor, a couple of bread & pastry booths, a fresh meat market vendor, kettle corn, frozen yogurt, a taco vendor & a variety of craft-type booths offering jewelry, purses, dried & decorated gourds (gorgeous) & lawn ornaments.",availability
"While their location is idea for visibility, it is not ideal for parking.",environment
"We only had to walk a block from where we parked, which isn't bad, but having to cross the railroad tracks can be a bit tricky for the elderly crowd (one, they are trying to hurry, which always makes me nervous, and two, they have to keep looking down to make sure they walk over the tracks so they can't keep looking up to see where they are actually going...I'm just glad I was there to hold Busia's arm & direct her while she looked down to watch her step).",environment
"When I saw that I couldn't check in at the Farmer's Market because it wasn't on Yelp yet, I was shocked!",Non-relevant
"This busy farmer's market appeared to have numerous satisfied customers, a regular clientele, and tons of great produce.",environment
"From the standard organic veggies you expect to see at a farmer's market to harder to find market goods like Farmer Nick's naturally-raised meats and free-range chicken eggs, you can get most of your fresh food shopping done here on Sundays between 8am and 1pm from June to October.",availability
"Everything is seasonal, so I say ""most"" because if you're like me, you want a couple of bananas every week to put in your Cheerios.",Non-relevant
"Beyond that, though, this market has such excellent variety that you can plan any number of meals without leaving this block-long stretch of stands.",availability
"I snapped up some sweet corn, brussels sprouts, and apples after waffling over whether to take home the season's last strawberries.",availability
"There are also a few unexpected things, like the guy sharpening knives on an old-school wheel (I love when markets have this!), the smoothie stand, the pizza-while-you-shop guys, and the fresh hummus stall, which has at least a dozen kinds of hummus plus packed olives and cornichons.",Non-relevant
You can even buy pastries from nuns.,availability
There were a couple of vendors that caused me to raise an eyebrow.,Non-relevant
"I expect to see marble wine bottle toppers at WineStyles, not at a farmer's market.",Non-relevant
"I would have liked to see something more fitting with the idea of local, sustainable products there instead, like Chicago rooftop honey.",quality
"The Lion's Club sponsors the market, and they are always accepting donations of used glasses, plus they accept used ink cartridges for recycling.",Non-relevant
"They also have themed market days from time to time, like the Fitness Fair and French Market Sunday.",Non-relevant
"Overall, this is a great Farmer's Market with more parking than the Park Ridge market that takes place on Saturday and just as many cute dogs being walked between the stalls.",environment
"I'll be back again, and I can't wait for fall produce to appear!",Non-relevant
I agree with everything Elizabeth W. said in 2011. 2013 continues with an excellent variety of fresh produce.,availability
Sometimes I splurge on the unusual mushrooms (crimini are my favorite).,Non-relevant
"Herbs, onions, gourds, corn, peaches, blueberries, all different kinds of raspberries, yum!",availability
"There are a couple of artists, too.",environment
"You can get almost your entire meal here, for what I think are reasonable prices (and I'm a German-bred stingy person!).",environment
"Most booths require cash, but some will accept credit cards now, thanks to smart phone technology.",environment
"Keep up the good work, MP Lions Club!",Non-relevant
Love this farmer's market.,Non-relevant
"Plenty of wonderful produce from Illinois, also Indiana and Michigan, too; Fresh baked pastries from an Oak Park convent; Artisanal cheeses and olives; Homemade doggie treats; Lovely handmade table linens, etc.",availability
Great way to meet neighbors and it is a very dog-friendly crowd.,environment
A nice way to start your Sunday morning....can't wait for it to return in late spring.,Non-relevant
A great farmers market with an excellent selection of products.,availability
This one is by far better than the one in Arlington Heights.,Non-relevant
Walk down to the vegetable stands on the very end.,Non-relevant
They usually have the best prices.,environment
My first time at a farmer's market here in the city (I lived in Michigan for 8 years and actually shopped at stands outside farms - so this is new to me!),Non-relevant
Lots of people and good range of goods.,availability
No bad experiences except that sometimes the nuns run out of pain-au-chocolate!,Non-relevant
Boo!,Non-relevant
Lesson learned: come earlier than later.,Non-relevant
"Where can you get an official French ""pain au chocolat"" (French chocolate-filled croissant type pastry) from an official French nun?",Non-relevant
"The Winfield Farmer's market, yeah, that's where!",Non-relevant
"I went here on a whim one Wednesday morning (it's open from 7am to 1pm on Wed. from June to October), because I'd seen the sign on the road every day as I drove to work.",Non-relevant
"They have sustainable, pastured meat and eggs and dairy.",quality
They have sustainable veggies.,quality
"They have random other stuff that doesn't really fit in anywhere, but , hey, it's fun to look at.",environment
"Really, it was my happy little transplanted foreigner's dream.",Non-relevant
"Not only did I get to speak French to a nun while asking for a pastry that was much more delicious than its preformed Panera Bread red-headed step-child relative, but I also walked out with pork heart and giant purple aspargus.",quality
Wait... you ask yourself.... why is this woman taking home a pig heart?,Non-relevant
"Does she participate in some sort of ritualistic, Indiana Jones-style sacrifice?",Non-relevant
"Worry not, my friend.",Non-relevant
Some people actually eat this stuff.,Non-relevant
"Cooked, diced, and sauteed.",Non-relevant
"Not like, raw and whole or something.",Non-relevant
Back to the Farmer's Market.,Non-relevant
I liked it except for the fact that it was fairly small.,environment
"I suppose that it IS Winfield, and farmers in the direct area are few and far between, but I was hoping for a little more.",Non-relevant
"Also, the sustainable and pastured meat was delivered through a meat broker (sounds shady, eh?",Non-relevant
It's really not).,Non-relevant
"Basically, they get meat, eggs, etc. from various farms within a 200 mile radius or something.",availability
They sell it at farmers markets.,Non-relevant
"So, it's more expensive than if the farmers themselves were to sell it.",Non-relevant
"My pig heart, for example was $6.",Non-relevant
Pig hearts are fairly small.,Non-relevant
"If you are taking notes on this for any reason other than culinary ones, please stop, as you are making me nervous.",Non-relevant
"I'll go back several times this summer, I'm sure.",Non-relevant
I need to get more chocolate pastries....,Non-relevant
This is where I go since I've sworn off the Wheaton French Market.,Non-relevant
"There's actually more vegetables here than 'stuff' and pastries, and it's not crowded to the point of being a hazard to walk through it.",environment
"There's no organic farms though, unlike the Wheaton market which had one organic farmer, so I have to cut a star for that.",quality
"But, if you want fresh local produce without the hyper-consumerism and crowds of the Wheaton market, this is the place to go!",environment
A great little market at the corner of County Farm Road and Geneva in Winflield.,environment
"Several produce vendors fresh from Michigan, a fresh donut maker, kettle popcorn vendor, That Pickle Guy, and Twin Farms that has the best corn around.",availability
A few jewelry vendors and other miscellaneous items--but this is a farmers market!,availability
Ample parking and lower prices than most markets around!,environment
Wednesday only.,Non-relevant
"What a great variety of fruits, veggies and other home-made yumminess.",availability
This is right by my house and I try to go every week!,Non-relevant
People are super friendly and helpful!,environment
I LOVE the South Loop Farmers Market!,Non-relevant
I have lived in the South Loop for over 30 years and was so happy once I heard we would have a market in the South Loop.,Non-relevant
We thought the day would never come!,Non-relevant
It's amazing to buy fresh fruit and vegetables along with fresh bread and come home and cook a real meal with such fresh produce.,availability
I try and go every week they are there.,Non-relevant
Also love supporting local farmers and other interesting things for sale.,environment
Thank you South Loop Farmers Market!,Non-relevant
Great addition to SLoop.,environment
"Small, but has everything you'd expect from a farmers market Holy Moly!!!",Non-relevant
This farmers market was awesome!,Non-relevant
I was invited to photograph it and had a blast!,Non-relevant
It's a beautiful spot tucked away next to The Second Presbyterian Church which is stunning!,Non-relevant
I learned that the church is having one of their large Tiffany Glass windows restored soon.,Non-relevant
And they give tours of the gothic gemstone.,Non-relevant
The Market itself was as diverse in goods as the neighborhood.,availability
I got some amazing coffee from a new roaster Sputnik $10/pound coffee that is on par with all the other great roasters this city has.,environment
"Beautiful flowers from Larkspur Flowers, whom actually grow their own flowers in Michigan I learned.",environment
HOW LOCAL IS THAT!!!!,quality
I feel like all the vendors were hand picked to fill the market with the best of the best who all had smiles on their faces.,environment
Don't even get me started on the fruits and cheeses!!!! ; ) I plan on being there every Thursday!,Non-relevant
"For Sean S. who didn't enjoy his last visit, I urge you to come back, I'll buy you an Ice cream from Yoberri I promise you wont be disappointed.",Non-relevant
"I went on September 29th, the last day of the market.",Non-relevant
"Only one vendor was there, Bread from Heaven.",availability
There was a banner across the street saying the Farmers Market happens rain or shine.,Non-relevant
I checked their website and nothing was mentioned about it being closed due to weather.,Non-relevant
"I asked the vendor, who said they were told 'today was the last day and the market was closing early because it was windy.'",Non-relevant
They could still be there if they wanted.,Non-relevant
No signs from the manager of the market stating that was the case.,environment
The South Loop Farmers Market lost a potential customer for next year because of lack of communications.,environment
This market serves as a much needed addition to the neighborhood.,environment
It's a small market with great vendors and they're growing all the time.,environment
I'm excited for the upcoming 2017 season!,Non-relevant
This is a great little farmer's market.,environment
I have been meaning to come here for a while.,Non-relevant
Everything that we got here was superb.,quality
The cheese from the cheese vender was absolutely delicious.,quality
The fresh peaches from one of the the produce vendors were fresh and juicy.,quality
And the blueberry scones from one of the bakery vendors were some of the best scones I've ever had.,quality
We only picked up a few things but I will definitely be stopping by here more often now.,Non-relevant
"The prices are a bit high, but like someone else said on here, it is supply and demand.",availability
You are getting a lot of fresh and tasty goods in an area where a lot of people don't mind spending a little extra.,quality
They are fairly reasonable though.,environment
"Overall, if you haven't been here, you should try it!",Non-relevant
Glad I finally found a nice farmer's market in Chicago.,Non-relevant
"By the way, the biggest produce vendor does accept credit cards which is nice.",Non-relevant
You need to make sure you go to this market early in the season.,Non-relevant
We went on the last day and the produce was not that great.,quality
A bit rotten honestly.,safety
But the pastries and cheeses were excellent.,quality
They have more to choose from early on in the season and I'm not going to give them a poor rating for something beyond their control.,Non-relevant
We'll definitely be back to check them out in the spring!,Non-relevant
"Anticipated moving into Lakeview for some time, mainly for easy access to this Saturday market.",Non-relevant
"However, I soon found out the difference between one of the city's farmers markets and this French market: choices.",Non-relevant
The number of vendors is disappointing as well as the variety of offerings.,availability
Possibly it's the space limitation?,Non-relevant
Big on charm but small on substance.,environment
I'll stick with the larger downtown and north side weekday markets.,Non-relevant
"This has gone on ever since I have been in Chicago, small but nicely ""curated"" with a well picked collection of desserts, vegetables, and other specialty items.",availability
"However the most I have ever purchased is a scone or cookie, the prices on the produce always seemed a little higher than the better deals in The Corporations.",environment
"However I am in support of The Idea of these great little markets, they have so many good finds on average, and this one is an oasis in an otherwise bland concrete jungle of a neighborhood.",environment
We're there virtually weekly throughout the season.,Non-relevant
Produce is great; cheese is great; bakery is very good.,quality
We especially like the friendly folks from Klug Farms and the cheese vendor.,environment
This market is small and limited for Lakeview.,environment
"There only one flower vendor, no more than four vendors selling veggies, four vendors selling baked goods and couple vendors selling jewelry.",availability
"The prices are a little higher than the other markets, however, the market is good if you need some fresh veggies or fruit if you don't have time to go to the Lincoln Park market on Armitage.",availability
The aisle are narrow so not a good place to bring pets or strollers.,environment
When I can't come here my house's produce severely suffers.,Non-relevant
Love the deals and people!!,environment
"This market, which is not actually a city-sponsored farmer's market is small but nice.",environment
"They have a bread guy that I really, really like..",Non-relevant
He has some good stuff...,Non-relevant
"Ciabatta, great pretzel rolls, etc.",availability
"Expect to pay, but it's good.",quality
There's another guy who does bread only from whole wheat type stuff...,Non-relevant
"They usually have 3 or 4 produce vendors... one specializes more in fruit, another has Mirai corn and other stuff, another has a little bit of everything. if you've never had mirai corn, go here and check it out!",availability
"There's a lady selling baked goods, and an olive oil booth type guy.",Non-relevant
And a lady selling flowers...,Non-relevant
And a cheese person (a bit lackluster though),Non-relevant
"Unlike city-sponsored markets, they also have a few people selling crafts.",Non-relevant
"I never check those out, but maybe you'll find something you like.",Non-relevant
Oh what a lovely place!,environment
Sadly I am not in Chicago that often to enjoy this market to it's fullest.,Non-relevant
As a matter of fact the first and only time I have gone most of the stores were not even open yet.,Non-relevant
BUT it was still a great expierence.,environment
It is going on my list of places to stop each and everytime I find myself in Chicago!,Non-relevant
This market makes my Saturday mornings!,Non-relevant
"When I didn't have a job for a short time and was bored and just wanted to get out and enjoy this new city that I moved into, I stumbled across this market.",Non-relevant
"Now in Texas we have farmer's markets, but they're really just outdoor supermarkets (seriously, they're not so much fun).",Non-relevant
I love the guys from the bakery in Geneva!,Non-relevant
And YUM!!!,quality
The pretzel bread there is a weakness of mine!,Non-relevant
"The last weekend of the market, I buy about 3 bags of that and freeze it for the winter to enjoy.",Non-relevant
The produce I love b/c I find it to be more affordable and better quality than the stores.,quality
It's not huge which I love b/c I see the same people all the time - just the neighborhood people.,environment
And the I *have* to buy flowers every time I go which has never been me but now I have to have fresh flowers in the house every week.,Non-relevant
"This is a great start to a Saturday morning, grab your reusable back, the dog and a coffee, and go out to shop with the locals!",environment
There's nothing better and another one of the countless reasons I love Chicago!,Non-relevant
"Great baked goods, several farm stands, fresh flowers, and a changing assortment of other booths.",availability
"This is a small, neighborhood market, organized by a company that sets up farmers markets in Paris.",environment
I should be going here for the fresh fruits and vegetables -- you won't see strawberries like these at the supermarket! -- but it's really the pretzel bread and cheese loaf that get me out of bed on a Saturday morning.,availability
"You can find seasonal produce (we're in strawberry & rhubarb time right now), as well as a selection of staples (potatoes, onions, lettuces), and usually some specialty items.",availability
"Several stands sell their own jams and jellies, and a bee-keeper has been offering honey there lately, too.",availability
"There are frequently stands with specialty food items, like barbecue sauce, olives, or cheeses.",availability
"In addition, you'll find a changing array of jewelry-sellers, local artists (got a real deal on a painting of the Illinois prairie last week, because it was raining and the artist wanted to make a sale -- that doesn't happen at Jewel!), and craftspeople.",environment
The market is open from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. and you can easily combine a trip here with breakfast at one of the many local brunch spots or coffee shops.,Non-relevant
Great farmer's market with a unique selection of vendors.,availability
"The big produce stand is great and accepts credit cards, but make sure to check out the bread folks (olive bread) and the cheese stand (string cheese and cheese curds), great stuff.",environment
I love this market too.,Non-relevant
Some of the original vendors are still there since it launched (3 yrs ago?) so it's really nice to see them year after year.,Non-relevant
The pretzel bread is amazing (seems to be lots of agreement on this).,quality
"The produce is just picked, fresh and wonderful.",quality
I don't buy any vegies at grocery stores when the market is open.,Non-relevant
"This year, there's a yummy olive oil vendor and some jams and jellies.",availability
"The craft vendors don't take booths for the season but rotate, so you never know who will be there from week to week.",Non-relevant
"The Nettelhorst School courtyard is definitely one of my ""go to"" Sat morning hangouts.",Non-relevant
OMG to cute to boot!,environment
I love this little market and it completely made my Saturday morning!,Non-relevant
"All of the fresh breads, herbs, oils, veggies and fruits blend together to make some of the best smells in the city.",availability
This is my second market experience and I must say even though this one was smaller I fell in love with it right away!,Non-relevant
Everyone is so friendly and helpful and the prices are define.,environment
I know a lot of people say they've noticed a price increase in items because of the economy well not here!,environment
I know I mentioned this is a smaller market.,Non-relevant
Maybe 20-30 vendors as someone else mentioned but I spent nearly 45 minutes here wandering around and taking it all in.,Non-relevant
I will definitely be back.,Non-relevant
I'm from a smaller town and this little market reminds me of home!,environment
Love this local Farmer's Market and try to make a trip there every Saturday.,Non-relevant
The produce is fresh and delish.,quality
"Last summer, there was a vendor there selling beautiful Italian photographs.",Non-relevant
Wish I would have gotten her card...any Yelpers have her info or website?,Non-relevant
"Pros: Convenient location, fresh fruits and vegetables, competitive prices, satisfaction from buying fresh food at a local market.",quality
Cons: Slightly small.,environment
I really like this small and sweet lil neighborhood market.,environment
Last Saturday was my first time here and I regret not going here earlier.,Non-relevant
The place is small so there are just 1-2 stalls per item.,environment
A bigger place would probably give more options.,availability
"But nevertheless, the stalls that are present are pretty good.",quality
I bought my weekly quota of vegetables and fruits which were all very fresh.,quality
"The prices are comparable to those at whole foods (which is where I usually shop), a couple of veggies seemed slightly higher but others were almost equally or even slightly lower priced.",environment
"The peaches were wonderful, they were soft and juicy and worth every cent I spent on them(4$ for a box of abt 6-7 good sized peaches).",quality
I am surely going again for the remaining few weeks that are left before the onset of winter.,Non-relevant
"Fresh food, friendly vendors, and right by my apartment!",environment
Going to the Farmer's Market never ceases to amuse me. the flowers are lovely.,environment
What a cute lil farmers market!,environment

"I love that it's 2 blocks from my places and can't wait to enjoy it next summer, as sadly the season is drawing to a close.",Non-relevant
Great find in East Lakeview!,Non-relevant
Can't wait for them to start up again in a few weeks ...,Non-relevant
Last year they had Brussel Sprouts the size of your fist that were the best I've ever had!,availability
And I can't say enough about those pretzel rolls ...,Non-relevant
"Ahhh, breakfast at Stella's, a little walk down to Melrose ...",Non-relevant
Great way to spend a weekend morning!,Non-relevant
"Spring, hurry up and get here!",Non-relevant
"I went to this market today, hoping to find organic vegetables and be able to give my money to the local economy instead of big corporate conglomerates like Albertsons or Safeway.",quality
"I asked one of the guys about some of the vegetables and how they are grown, and I was surprised to find out that they are grown conventionally (hot house and with pesticides).",quality
He didn't seem to know a lot about the vegetables and that the actual owners don't' come out to these farmers markets.,Non-relevant
"So I asked if I could pay them a visit, and he told me they dont' take visitors.",Non-relevant
Is it because they don't want the public to see their own practices?,Non-relevant
Maybe their vegetables are no better than Jewel or Dominicks?,Non-relevant
I don't know.,Non-relevant
"I also met a woman there who was dressed like she was amish, but after talking to the first guy, it made me wonder if it was a gimmick.",Non-relevant
"If you're buying from farmers markets to support local farmers and get organic fresh produce, this is not the one to go to.",quality
"They are slightly more expensive than the chain grocery stores, but it does not seem worth the cost.",quality
"They do have nice crafts there, that I would consider checking out though, I also personally dont' eat any dairy products, so I can't speak about the quality of those items, but I think your money would be better spent on another place's vegetables.",quality
What a great find along route 59!,Non-relevant
"I religiously hit the farmers market every Saturday morning, but last Saturday I couldn't get up in time, and I assumed I was SOL for the week.",Non-relevant
"My son was playing in a football game @ Commissioner's Park down on 111th, so I found myself in this neck of the woods in the afternoon.",Non-relevant
"I was pretty psyched to see this place, so I drove in and found some amazing produce sold by really nice people!",quality
"Most of the stuff they sell is locally grown, and what isn't local is clearly labeled.",quality
"I'm not a ""locavore"" and I think the whole concept is kind of silly, but I do love the freshness of the farmers markets and farmstands.",quality
"These folks tell you exactly where you are getting your produce from, so if that's important to you, they've got you covered.",environment
Their carrots here are amazing.,quality
For years we used to buy the baby carrots at the grocery store.,Non-relevant
"Let me tell you, the real carrots that you have to peel and cut are 100x tastier than baby carrots, and the carrots here are the best I've ever seen (or tasted).",quality
"I also picked up some beautiful arugula (just barely bitter and delicious), celery, 6 ears of corn, and a few other items.",quality
They also have a really beautiful selection of pastas and honey.,availability
Prices were VERY reasonable.,environment
"For the quality I would have honestly paid more, but I got out for less than $25 for over a week's worth of produce.",quality
"They are really nice people, and they even take credit cards (which is great).",environment
Overall an excellent farmstand!,Non-relevant
I will be back the next time my kids have games out this way.,Non-relevant
"I might even make a special trip or two just to get more of those carrots, too.",Non-relevant
Really cute little farmstand/nursery.,environment
All the produce looked really fantastic and fresh.,quality
There were all sorts of homemade items in jars.,availability
Jams and jellies.,availability
Fresh honey and maple syrup as well.,Non-relevant
The only reason I'm giving them a 4 star review is the fact that unless you had a landscaper you could not purchase items out in the fields.,Non-relevant
"I get it that many people are fine with hiring a landscaper, but my husband and I prefer to do our own landscaping.",Non-relevant
I am not sure why this was a requirement and I hope in the future they will rethink this as it deters probably many more customers.,environment
One of the best farmstand I have been.,Non-relevant
Very clean and fun to go around.,safety
Lots of fresh veggies.,quality
Love the onion and the eggs that they sell are the best.,Non-relevant
"Love the hot peppers, fresh spinach.....",Non-relevant
I can go on and on about this place.,Non-relevant
The ladies are wonderful and wish them the best.,Non-relevant
I have been a fan of this farm stand since we discovered it.,Non-relevant
And my latest experience there has left much to be desired.,Non-relevant
"One of the clerks, a blonde woman with a practical bob was very rude to me and my daughter.",Non-relevant
And when we moved from the tomato area she took away every tomato I and my daughter touched.,Non-relevant
She accused my daughter if squeezing them when she hadn't.,Non-relevant
And for her to talk to a 4 year old and not me directly seemed wrong.,Non-relevant
I have no idea what that was about but I will not pay money to be insulted.,Non-relevant
There are quite a few farm stands in the area.,availability
And a French market nearby.,Non-relevant
I'll take my business elsewhere.,Non-relevant
Awesome people and great variety of local (when possible) fruits and veggies.,availability
We come here almost every weekend.,Non-relevant
Very disappointing produce and even worse customer service.,quality
"Staff was too busy flirting with customers to take a question, and when finally talking to a manager they were condescending and abrupt.",environment
Produce left MUCH to be desired being dry and bitter when expected to be luscious and vibrant.,quality
"Fresh local produce and friendly, helpful service.",environment
"Took a ride out to the ""country"" to get tomatoes and fixin's so hubby could can a batch of his delicious chili sauce.",quality
"Great variety and lots of other items too such as jellys, popcorn kernel varieties and pickles.",availability
Definitely will return.,Non-relevant
"This is a nice produce stand housed in a little barn structure, the rural nature of which is oddly juxtaposed against the screaming traffic of Route 59 beyond.",Non-relevant
"Beyond carrying a variety of fruits and veggies -- potatoes, onions, pattypan squash, eggplant, zuchinni, green onion, radishes, apples, peaches, plums, blueberries, among other things -- they also have a number of jams and jellies, sauces, salsas, pickles, and pie fillings ready-made for sale.",availability
"I bought a half-dozen ears of bi-color corn for $2.50 I believe (they were pre-bundled and I prefer to choose my own from open stock, but the one I pulled out and had a look at looked good, and all the tassels were still golden and sticky, a sign of fresh ears).",quality
"I also got a little bunch of purple radishes, and the lady ringing us up threw in the last remaining bunch of radishes they had for free (it was nearing the end of the day, and ""they just looked so sad by themselves!"") I also nabbed a peach and a Jersey Mac apple -- easy breakfasts, and they looked so much better than the grocery store versions, particularly the apple!",Non-relevant
There is also a small selection of potted plants outside for sale.,availability
The bigger selection of plants off to the side are apparently sold only to landscapers.,availability
They are open daily from 9-6 through Halloween.,Non-relevant
"So the next time you're fitful for a forkful of the farm but you're cruising by in your convertible on 59, make a pit stop at Wagners and grab some greens.",Non-relevant
You should eat more roughage anyway.,Non-relevant
This farm stand has what I need and I frequent this establishment every two days!,Non-relevant
"Arugula, cilantro, basil (italian, lemon, thai), cucumbers, white and red potatoes.",availability
White corn and bi-color sweet corn.,Non-relevant
Rainier cherries.,Non-relevant
I buy the hot corn salsa and pour it over the arugula for extra spiciness.,Non-relevant
I also bought an Endless Summer Hydrangea from their flower collection.,Non-relevant
It's very large and healthy!,quality
"We love, love, love this farm stand!",Non-relevant
The corn is picked fresh every day and all the produce is fresh and good.,quality
And they sell a sauerkraut that is the best ever as well as great pickles.,quality
Highly recommended.,Non-relevant
I enjoy going to this small friendly farm stand every week from July all the way thru October!,environment
The corn never disappoints!,quality
"And the nectarines, grapes, tomatoes, potatoes, apples,(including honey crisp) pumpkins, and melons are so tasty!",availability
I am always so sad when it closes for the season.,Non-relevant
My favorite farmers market!!,Non-relevant
Right in my lovely Florissant hometown!,environment

The fruit is way past its eat by date let alone should be out for sale.,Non-relevant
They are also not a credit card friendly establishment.,environment
They require minimum of $10 to use credit.,Non-relevant
Who is going to spend $10 on produce that is going to spoil before you can eat it?,Non-relevant

Or the Dierbergs around the corner.,Non-relevant
Love this place!,Non-relevant

The produce is good and fresh.,quality
Everyone is very nice and helpful.,environment
Would be nice if they posted what types of payments they took and would be really nice if they took EBT.,Non-relevant
You may be here a while.,Non-relevant

Worth stopping if you are in the area.,Non-relevant
The Miller Beach Farmer's Market is great.,Non-relevant
I only wish that it were bigger and had more vendors.,environment
The honey stand (Panos Farm) sells the best honey I have ever tasted.,quality

Nice little farmers' market.,environment
"With a few local farm stands, a couple snack tents/trucks, and the occasional handicraft vendor.",environment

The guy and I stopped by this market and I could not believe how fantastic the prices were!,Non-relevant

"We had enough fruit for about a month, and we got the whole thing for $20.",Non-relevant
The best part is that this farmer's market is right in front of the new Whole Foods.,Non-relevant
See you next week!,Non-relevant
"I'm gong to go ahead and echo the reviewer below who said this is ""barely a farmer's market.""",Non-relevant
"It's more accurately about 8-10 booths set up in a church parking lot, and only half of them have food (produce, baked goods, and the other staples you would expect at a farmer's market).",environment
I was definitely disappointed.,Non-relevant
"I wasn't expecting the same size as Lincoln Park's, but this was a bit pathetic to be frank.",environment
"I'd save my time if I were you, but if you insist on trying it out, it takes place on Thursdays from 4-8pm.",Non-relevant
"Uhh......this is hardly a ""farmers"" market.",Non-relevant
It's mostly people selling a bunch of junk.,quality

We went there the first time a few months ago.,Non-relevant
There hours said open.,Non-relevant
Even the sign stated their opening time.,Non-relevant
We waited 20 minutes in the parking lot and they never opened.,environment
Then I took my son there to have a fun day to find out the rides are only available during the weekend.,environment
Okay I understand it because school is in session but there are still moms that have preschoolers and while the weather is nice is looking for some fun things to do.,environment
I am sure a group of moms looking for a play date would agree.,Non-relevant
But it wasn't just the fact that the rides were not available but the lady at the desk was so rude.,Non-relevant
She was not personable or anything.,Non-relevant
Almost like she tried to be belittling.,Non-relevant
But honey your no better then the next.,Non-relevant
I don't think Ill ever waste my time going there again.,Non-relevant
I'd rather pay a little bit more and know that I wont be stressed by people showing up late and people being ignorant.,Non-relevant

We love coming here because it is so interactive for the whole family.,environment
"I'm giving them a 3, I only bought corn but I wouldn't go back for it, wasn't very good or fresh.",quality
I gave an extra star because the employees are friendly.,environment

Swarms of mosquitoes!,safety
Apples were good but we had to pick them in about 15 minutes because we were being eaten alive!,quality
No fun at all.,environment
Won't go next year without checking.,Non-relevant

You can find me at the Urbana Farmer's Market every Saturday!,Non-relevant
I LOVE it!,Non-relevant
Here's some tips....,Non-relevant
Too expensive?,environment
This market is one of those markets where the vendor has to grow or make what it's selling.,quality
That means that things are higher quality than other markets where a lot of vendors buy fruit and vegetables in bulk from distributors and resell it.,quality
Want to save money?,Non-relevant
"Check out the ""seconds"" bins underneath the table tops.",Non-relevant
This is where you can get produce like tomatoes for sometimes half the price!,availability
Too crowded?,environment
SHOW UP EARLY!,Non-relevant
The retired folks do it right.,environment
"Get there before 9am, and you'll avoid the strollers and impatient crowds.",environment
Not finding what you're looking for?,availability
This goes back to the fact that the vendor has to grow what it sells.,quality
"Obviously, you're probably not going to find cucumbers in August.",availability
They just don't typically grow around that time around here.,Non-relevant
"Although, it all depends on the year.",Non-relevant
A warm spring means you might find tomatoes as early as May.,availability
A cool summer means you might find cucumbers in August.,availability

The good stuff always goes fast!,Non-relevant
The farmer's market is one of my favorite things to do every Saturday!,Non-relevant

The in-season product is so good.,quality

"Offerings throughout the season include baked goods, jams, handcrafts, jewelry, soaps and salves.",availability
There's plenty of free parking for both cars and bikes.,environment
It's easy access.,environment
Bring sunscreen if you're going to hang and bring your own shopping bags if you can.,Non-relevant
There's all sorts of music going on.,environment
"And sometimes there are special programs - like local bands, grilled pizza tutorials, bike clinics (where you can get a free tune up!), blood drives if you're able to donate, etc.",environment

There isn't much better than watching locals buy local products and seeing smiles galore.,environment

Hopscotch isn't at the market this year but you can still get Kaya's goodies at Art Mart on Prospect.,Non-relevant
"Today we purchased some sweet corn, tomatoes, onions, arugula and kale.",availability
All of these items were grown in the CU area.,quality
"True, you may pay a bit more than at Wal-Mart or Meijer but you are supporting your neighbors rather than a large corporation.",environment

The smell of kettle corn tempts me every time!,quality
Cool farmers market my friends took me to while visiting.,Non-relevant

It's why I wake up early on Saturday morning.,Non-relevant
A must-visit for anyone in the Champaign-Urbana area.,Non-relevant
Tons of vendors from all over Central Illinois set up to share their organic and hand-crafted goodness with the local consumers.,availability

Check out the co-op supermarket while you are there.,Non-relevant
"Sorry to say it, but the Urbana Farmers Market is overpriced.",environment
"I cannot imagine spending $3.00 a pound for string beans, for example.",Non-relevant
Tomatoes are also priced at $3.00 a pound even when the vendors' tables groan with them in August.,availability
New York's Union Square greenmarket is cheaper!,Non-relevant

"I go once in a while to buy zucchini, onions, and garlic and to get tomatoes from vendors who sell the ones with blemishes for $2.00 a pound or less.",availability
"If you poke around you can find some bargains, but this is the most expensive farmers market I've ever been to unfortunately.",Non-relevant
"I cannot for the life of my understand why this market, in the middle of (and close driving distance from) farmland, is priced on average higher than my local Beverly Hills, CA farmer's market.",environment
Why would I pay more for local crops in Champaign than irrigated stuff driven more than an hour in to LA?,Non-relevant
Blah.,Non-relevant
"Aside from that, this is actually a pretty great farmers market.",environment
"Big (bigger than most where I live, though we have multiple throughout the city every day of the week, so I suppose that's why) and with a great selection.",environment

Music is a mixed bag to put it nicely.,environment
Great place for kids to practice their violin lessons and make some good money.,environment

Yet many people think it's fine art.,Non-relevant
"That being said, there are a few surprises worth noting, mainly in specialty food products.",quality
"But honestly, it's not stuff that you can only get there.",Non-relevant
Also the crowds and parking is a drag.,environment
And it seems like the prices just keep getting higher yet people race back there even faster.,environment
I think I'll just stick to buying my unglamorous but cheap produce at Meijer...,Non-relevant
This is actually one of the best farmers markets I've ever been to!,Non-relevant

"I like the influx of the food trucks, but Fryer Tucks was first and I find myself falling back to wanting a egg, cheese, and sausage on a wheat english muffin with onions.",Non-relevant
They use eggs and sausage from the local vendors.,Non-relevant
"I think Cracked might also use local eggs, but not sure.",Non-relevant
"There are your mainstay vendors, but every year there is some turn over with new farmers or artisans that help to make every year a little different.",Non-relevant
The live music provided by good and not so good musicians also lends to the character of the market.,environment
It is also nice to peruse the various community groups whom are out there.,environment

Great little local shop!,environment

I went to the freezer section to grab a pizza and noticed it was off.,Non-relevant
They owners were putting bags of ice at the bottom.,Non-relevant
The food was not even close to frozen.,Non-relevant
I asked the young woman who works the register where the owner was and she told me it was under new management.,environment
I then went to the butcher section and decided to see what was going on.,Non-relevant
I asked for a pre-packaged pack of chicken thighs and as soon as it was handed to me and I could smell it.,Non-relevant
The same thing happened to my roommate days after.,Non-relevant
I truly think its only a matter of time before someone gets sick eating their meat here.,Non-relevant
But that wasn't all that changed.,Non-relevant
"After passing on the chicken thighs, I decided to grab a can of Amy's soup since I didn't trust anything that was cooled or frozen in the store.",Non-relevant
I went to the register and she told me it was $3.99 plus tax for the can of soup.,Non-relevant
I laughed and walked out.,Non-relevant
The old owners were as kind as could be and maintained an immaculate store with the freshest of produce and meat.,quality
"The new owners have turned the place into a horrible smelling, overpriced and an unfriendly store.",quality
It's a shame for us Logan Square residents.,Non-relevant

And the LaCroix variety is really top notch .,availability
I've compared the prices to Mariano's with no noticeable difference so I try to come here whenever I can and support local.,environment
Farmer's Pride on Milwaukee is a gem of a grocery-far beyond any bodega or convenience store.,Non-relevant

"After we'd gotten most of the produce, the clerk came and asked if I was still looking for fresh bread as they'd just gotten a delivery from the bakery that makes their bread.",availability
"I said yes, and he got a huge and lovely baguette.",Non-relevant
It smelled so good it was all I could do to not simply start gnawing on it right in the store (Because I'm really classy like that).,quality
He's also asked if there are specific things we'd like them to stock to let us know so that they can carry them.,Non-relevant

Bonus points that they generally always have cheap chicken along with excellent pork cuts and fish.,quality

Their vegetable and herb selection are also pretty wide while still managing to be fresh.,availability
"We didn't expect them to have fresh fennel for a fennel / apple salad, but they did.",availability
"I've stopped going to Marianos for a lot of the cheeses as most of the nice sharp cheddars, mozzarella, or gouda they keep in stock for less money.",Non-relevant
"It just doesn't make sense for me to shop anywhere else when Farmer's Pride Produce has everything we want, plus the things we don't even know we want for a reasonable price.",availability
"Lastly, this is a family owned place.",environment
"I've met the owner, his wife, and at least one of his young daughters.",environment
I'm all about supporting local businesses vs big corporate stores so the money stays in the local economy.,environment
It just happens that the quality here trounces pretty much anything within a mile or two for a massive plus.,quality
Cliff Notes: Shutup and take my money!,Non-relevant
My wife and I just moved to the neighborhood and this is the closest grocery store.,environment

All of their dairy items are way overpriced and a lot of it is expired.,safety

Everyone go here so we make sure they stay in business please.,Non-relevant

Other stuff they sell here like snacks and drinks seemed like ordinary selection except for a few things like chocolate.,availability

I was disappointed.,Non-relevant
I got the chicken wrap and the hubby got the turkey Swiss sandwich.,Non-relevant
Both were past their prime and offered no relief from our hunger after a 2 hour delay.,Non-relevant
"The brownies, peppermint chocolate bark and other sweets looked amazing--and we planned to come back after the sandwiches--but we didn't since it was such a fail.",Non-relevant
I'd advise you try to something else when hanging around gate G1.,Non-relevant
"The lady, sorry, woman, working here at 9:15pm on 12/20/15 was incredibly rude and disrespectful.",environment

How am I supposed to afford locally grown produce if I sacrifice business hours to do so?,Non-relevant

Opening at 7.30a on a Sat is the way to go.,Non-relevant
"Get going on time, you're out by 8.15a.",Non-relevant

"After arguing that my dog was not actually a service dog (even though she is and I had all appropriate documentation), she responded that didn't care anyway.",environment
She kicked me out of the market.,Non-relevant

"Furthermore, the woman at the Evanston Township booth told me that she didn't believe that she was certified to do anything special and dogs love humans no mater what; she has no idea what my disability is and the certifications my dog has earned to support me.",Non-relevant
It was incredibly offensive and discriminatory and I will never ever be returning back to support this organization.,environment
