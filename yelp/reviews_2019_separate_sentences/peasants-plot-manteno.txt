we've been a member for a few years and i'm always so excited for the season's first pickup. the veggies are delicious - i cook a lot but joining a CSA definitely pushed me to learn new recipes and focus on local, in season produce. the weekday pickup options are great too & i love the little notes that come with our weekly shares. i am so glad we found this CSA!
