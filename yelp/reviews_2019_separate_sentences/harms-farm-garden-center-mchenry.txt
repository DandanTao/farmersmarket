Harms Farms solved so many problems for me!
This nursery had the bushes I had been looking for since just forever!
They carry plants for my garden that I could not find anywhere.
No one else had kohlrabi.
We love it.
I always check Harms Farm in McHenry first when I am in the mood to plant!!Worst owners I have ever encountered.
Teresa is not friendly and doesn't care if you are a long time customer of 30+ years.
She is very rude and will argue just to argue.
I've never met more of a rude person in my life.
I do not recommend anyone purchasing from this company or going to the accounting division.
I would stay far and clear of this awful person and her tacky personality.

For the owner: Please learn some manners and maybe you won't have customers running for the hills.I've been a Harm's customer for 2 years and I'm very happy with their service.
They have a non nonsense approach to landscaping needs.
Definitely recommend.
