Another year, another Horner Park Farmer's Market.
I have loved this particular one for years.
So nice to see the community, families, couples, individuals, and many sweet 4 legged beings come together.
Small, but packs a punch.
Beautiful flowers, great produce, cheeses, meat.
Great place.Ridiculously overpriced produce.
Small selection.
Hit up the Lincoln Square market on Tuesday mornings and Thursday nights instead.
Better prices and products.
