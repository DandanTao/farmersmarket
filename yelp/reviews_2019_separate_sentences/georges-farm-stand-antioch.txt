Nice people, in season vegetables picked daily.
I made dill pickles and mixed vegetable pickles with their produce, both batches turned out nice and crisp.A convenient little stop to pick up produce off of Highway 45 in Antioch.
They don't have a huge selection, but we found some good things.
They also carry honey and home made jams and jellies.

BTW, best nectarines I have ever had!
Extremely sweet and juicy!
