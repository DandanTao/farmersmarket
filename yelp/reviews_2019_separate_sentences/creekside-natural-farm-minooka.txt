Best place to get free range organic-fed chickens.
Pam and Bill take such great pride in raising the chickens, and their organic produce.
It is great to find a farm nearby that cares about the food they grow.I love stopping by here to pick up fresh vegetables and eggs when they are in season.
I would give it five stars, except it is a bit pricier than the other cage free eggs and organic produce around.
Still, well worth a trip!My go to place for cage free eggs.
They mainly sell eggs and vegetables (seasonal) from their farm.
There's a gazebo right when you turn onto their property with two coolers inside that contain what's available at the moment with a money drop box.
Its nice to have a nearby place that sells locally-grown perishables.
