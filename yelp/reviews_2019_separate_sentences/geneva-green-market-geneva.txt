It's the best market I've been to in the Tri-City area.
The vendors are from sustainable sources.
There's amazing produce.
There's a cheese guy.
There's a local meat guy.
There's great bread.
What more can you ask for??
If you love quality ingredients, go here every Thursday when in season (June-October).
Also, friendly people run the market.
(It's located on the west side of the river, just north of rt. 38)
