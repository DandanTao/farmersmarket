I am not sure if this is the same Farmer's market, the one we attended was off Main street, behind some shops in a parking lot.

This is a small market but with a good variety of vendors.
The cheese guy was my favorite, and we picked up a couple of varieties.
There were plenty of fresh veggies, a massage chair, and even a maple stand with maple sugar, syrup and other tasty items.
