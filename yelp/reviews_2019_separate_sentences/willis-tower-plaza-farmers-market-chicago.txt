Movin' to the country gonna eat a lotta peaches Movin' to the country gonna eat a lotta peaches

Mich-i-gan Peaches, peaches for me!
Mich-i-gan Peaches, peaches for free!

The Willis Farmer's Market is on Thursdays in 2011 from June 16 until October 6, from 7am-3pm.

Not much of a variety here, but there is usually a Michigan farmstand with a good selection of corn on the cob and peaches.
I wish they were free!
But be nice, and they'll toss in an extra peach!

There are a few vendors with cooked food you can get for lunch, too.

I like the Mother/Son flower vendors from St. Anne- same ones as at the Logan Square Farmer's Market.
Buy some nice flowers for that someone special...on Thursday!
