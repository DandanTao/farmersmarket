I have passed this gem numerous times, finally stopped in.
What a find, if you can, this is the go to place for your veggies.
The produce is beautiful, and plentiful.
I have found the place for eggs, tomatoes, peppers and all the good wholesome things I love to eat.
Take the time and find this for yourself, you will be HAPPY!!Sweet family owned farm in northwest Illinois.
Their vegetables are fresh and homegrown.
Simple and sweet.Today was their first day open and they will be open until it gets cold.
We were there for fresh sweet corn which they started picking today.
They have cole crops like cabbage and tomatoes that come from southern Illinois until their own plants have ripe tomatoes.
You will love the people who work there.
We will return many times while we are in the area.Love this place;great produce and staff!
Looking forward to next summer and their wonderful selection.
