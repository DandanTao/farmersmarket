This is a great way to get place to get the community together.
I came here to meet up with MSU alumni to help by volunteering to help prepare the farm for their planning and growing season.
I will definitely have to come back and do more in the future.
They start selling their produce in June so buy local and support the farm and effort!Part of the Urban Farm movement in Chicago, this farm is a great place to learn about farming and get some good exercise volunteering.
Very friendly staff.
