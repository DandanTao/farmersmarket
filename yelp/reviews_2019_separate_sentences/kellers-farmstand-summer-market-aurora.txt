I've stopped by Keller's farmstand summer market by the Fox Valley Mall just east of Re-Store.
I had noticed their stand there for a while, but no one ever seemed to be there.
I think they opened sometime in early to mid-July and should be open daily for the next several months.
I bought some excellent sweet corn and some very good tomatoes.
I asked about the source of the produce.
They grew the corn on their farm in Oswego, but it was too early for their tomatoes.
These tomatoes had come from Arkansas.
They also had some zucchini, yellow squash, cucumbers, and onions.
I drive by here nearly every day on my way home from work, so I'll be stopping back particularly to get more corn.
