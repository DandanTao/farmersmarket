This is a nice little farmer's market in downtown Wauconda.
There are a variety of vendors selling fruits and vegetables, meats, canned items, candy, shaved ice, as well as crafty items.
The market is right in the heart of the downtown shopping area, so many of the area shops have sidewalk sales as well.
The various vendor's pricing seemed to be in line and fair for what you'd expect for a farmer's market.
Today I just came home with fruits and veggies but I'm looking forward to going back on a cooler day to browse some of the other items for sale!
