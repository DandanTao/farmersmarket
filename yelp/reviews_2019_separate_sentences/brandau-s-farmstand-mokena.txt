Great people, great corn.
Freshest produce around,and their children are polite and darn good looking too.The corn on the cob was so sweet and delicious our family of four polished off a bag of 15 cobs in one sitting!
So yummy. 15 cobs for $4.99.
We also bought a very good, sweet and juicy watermelon.
We spent only ten dollars our first trip there.
We will be hitting this farm stand again VERY soon!Love this place!
The corn on the cob is my absolute favorite!
I find myself frequenting Brandau's multiple times a week during the summer.
All of the produce is fresh and tasty.
This place has THE BEST Michigan peaches you will ever taste.
It's family owned and the guys there couldn't be nicer.
