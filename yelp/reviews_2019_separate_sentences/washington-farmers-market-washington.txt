Saturday 6/22/13 was the first Washington Farmers' Market.
Because of the amount of rain we've had and flooded fields, produce may be a little slow this summer.
My wife was quite pleased with the lettuce.
Much better than store-bought, according to her.
The radishes tasted good, but some were "woody". The strawberry preserves were excellent!
We also had crafters come in: one lady all the way from Lincoln.
Her shop is The Cloth Penguin, and she has baby bands, jewelry, skirts, and other stuff.
Reach her at jfrawleyb@comcast.net.
Another crafter had his wife staff the booth: thesycamoretree.net.
He sells unique gift items.
I'm looking forward to next Saturday when we might have more farmers show up.
Northtown Farms specializes in pork burgers.
Garden Marketplace specializes in vegetables.
