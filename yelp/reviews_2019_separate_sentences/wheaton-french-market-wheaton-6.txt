Thought I had reviewed this previously.
This is our favorite farmers' market in the area.
There is a wide selection of products and the wonderful smell of crepes being prepared, greets you.
It is set up up in one of the parking lots on Liberty and Main.
The market is held on Saturday mornings starting in April ( I think) and running, at least until the end of October.
Of course, depending on what is in season, that will have the largest selection.
There are multiple produce stands, so check them all out before making your purchase.
Flowers are always a "must buy".
This is a perfect way to spend a few hours on a Saturday morning.
